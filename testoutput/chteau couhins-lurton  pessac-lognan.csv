8,"Damn! Elegant! Damn elegant! Initial herbaceous hit on the nose with a softer orchard fruit and well integrated buttery oakiness that blends in like camouflage. Decent mouth weight and chalky minerality. With oak and ripe fruit flavours yet retaining a freshness. M(+) acidity lending itself to the roundness. A shorter finish than I'd like, but a lovely drop."
9,"Dark ruby red colour. Ripe nose with chocolate, mint and dark fruit like cassis and plum with fine wood. The palate is dense with good weight, young texture but ripe tannin, fresh cassis and plum flavour, some notes of tobacco and a long, dense finish. 91/100"

21,"Very fresh, fruity and aromatic with notes of black currant leaves, gooseberry, nettles and citrus.Elegant, concentrated and with balanced oaky notes."
22,Peach. Grapefruit. Butter. A great vintage. Strangely reaching its peak with scent of cooked fruit. Could be storage condition. A solid bottle nonetheless.

29,"A refined SB from the Château Couhins-Lurton, which belongs to André Lurton Winery, Villenave d'Ornon, Pessac-Léognan, Bordeaux 🇫🇷! The fresh nose shows a whiff of honeysuckle, citrus oil and white flowers! Crispy and very elegant on the palate it opens with the enchanting bouquet of green apple, quince, gooseberry, vanilla, nutmeg and lemon peel flavours laced by delicate spicy tarragon notes! A charming fruity wine with balanced acidity and lingering mineral finish! Recommend! 91 - Robert Parker!"
30,"For sure interesting SB to try if you keen to extend your horizon 😜 Intense goldish color which closer to Chardonnay, fantastic nose of blossom, tropical fruits and Sea breeze. Aging in barrel left sign in body also - its medium bodied plus, but still very lively acidity and freshness punch 👌 Taste is loaded by grainy apples, Quince in sugar, some starfruit, lime and minerals dose. Aftertaste gives salty and bitter pleasure 😋 Like it despite, not formal presence 4++"
31,color is light lemon the first nose has a profound minerality and then the aromatic profile evolves into a tropical fruity style I got fresh melon ripe passion fruit overripe nectarine guava and finally the minerality and fruiness mixes together which reminds me of mixed tropical milk shake on the palate refreshing high acidity medium body medium alcohol it has a slight bitterness in the aftertaste which increases the complexity suitable for hot summer days arcachon balanced wine fatty sea food

43,"It is a white wine from Pessac Leognan more than 20 years ago. The golden liquid makes you feel the passage of time. Complex flavors such as grapefruit, cream, licorice and mint. It may be past the best time, but it is a wonderful wine."
44,"This is a ripe and complex left-bank Bordeaux, just perfectly matured. It’s bursting with flavor of baked apple, vanilla pod, butter and caramel, royally structured with a sheer never-ending finish. Honey and smoke begin to appear on the palate. The fruit is incredibly fresh, even if quite ripe, and the acidity is so refreshing. Super long finish with lemon and some ripe peach appearing."
45,"Bought this for two reasons: One, the vintage, two, to eliminate my non existing experience of Bordeaux Blanc. I rather liked this on. Peaches, lemon, gooseberries and some black currant leaf. Ah, and don’t forget the oak. Lovely and alive but rounded and mature at the same time."
46,"Straw yellow color with a greenish tint. On nose, butter, popcorn, grass and yellow apples. On pallet, crisp, butter, popcorn, nettles, grass, Green apples and lemon/unripe peach. Really fun primary wine for lysnatta evening. Had it with a butterfried perch with grated Green Apple on a Green parsley/butter emulsion. It worked, but the character if the wine might have needed a lot more power to match perfectly ä, like changing the perch with mackerel/herring."
47,"Deep yellow gold colored, rich in flavor SB. Rowan, oak, chokeberries, honey, mint lollipops, berries skins. Medium + acidity. Quince, lemon, bit of peach. Very long bittersour finish. A great choice for SB lovers!"

49,"Light golden colour. Black currant leaves, oak, gooseberry, lime, pine and lychee nose. Intense and wonderful palate following the nose. Long, lime, butter and roasted lemon finish. Very nice indeed. I've tasted a few younger versions of this wine from different vintages without seeing a potential for this result after ten years. Impressive. 4.5 stars It's a pop and pour wine only, though. Did not stand up to vacuvining overnight. 4 stars"
50,"On the nose you've got this pear that moves to citrus zest but also a note of Staedtler rubbers. The palate has stone fruit and citrus again, much softer acidity that comes in about halfway through and a subtle but decent finish."
51,"Rich and well balanced, intense on the nose. Oaked, but with great skill! It looks like a wheel that one by one carries up fruit, peach, mango, citrus, honey, toasted notes, hazelnut, butter, stone, aromatic herbs... And then everything returns to the taste, with great balance then between acidity and softness, with a long, long finish. Outstanding 🔝"
52,"Light gold colour. Nose of over-ripe fruits (cooked), peach, pear, apple, apricot, vanilla, butter, oaky. Bold, dry and crispy palate of citrus, melon, and med plus acidity. Good white, good vintage, but it is decreasing. Drink quickly."

92,"3.6 ProWein 2018, Düsseldorf, Germany, 18-20 March. Evening of Crus Classés de Graves. Medium intensive aroma of green pepper and sea stones, vanilla and wood, ice white fruits worth seeds. Dry, high acidity, full body, oily taste, straight, mineral, not easy drinkable, a bit stubborn and demands more time for opening its best sides, greenery bitterness, stays long at the end."
93,"Typical SB notes and full in character, elderflower, currant bush, nettles, gooseberry. Oak characters. Some bread. In mouth large body, oily. A little burnt."

95,"Fantastic full bodied Bordeaux. Green pepper, butter, citrus and a hint of mango and pineapple . Well balanced. Extremely complex and delicious. Very long finish."

98,"Fresh, integrated oak, citrus, minerals, can be stored for a long time more. Nice wine."

139,"Presented at the beginning of a 2016 presentation of Bordeaux, given blind guessed 2010 vintage, warm feeling. Dark golden in color. Floral notes with scents of oak and butter on the nose. Oak and butter clearly present on the palate as well. Falls a bit through, my rating is 3.5"
140,"At a friend's dinner this was served. I feel guilty for the 3* star rating but just couldn't bring myself to like it. Undeniably a good wine though. 100% SB, fermented and aged for 10m on the lees in oak. Short notes due to chatting. Grass, hay, herbaceous, toast minerals and flint. Lime, green apple, gooseberry. Still high in acidity but possibly past peak, good complexity."
141,"3.6 — Lovely oxidative notes with a powerful, young and lively acidity hit. This has been aged properly and is nice to drink now. Would make a lovely pair to a caramelized pork chop or aged comte cheese. C: Deep gold N: Rusty apple, honey, rowan, parsnip, apricot. P: Yellow apple, croissants, more apricot, orange peel. Complex Med- body, high acidity, long finish. Big thanks for Ernestas for introducing this GCC P-L. Your effort is valued 🙏🏻, this will be harder than breaking my ice with Rioja 🤣."
142,"3.3 - white. I struggled with this wine. Very pale with a bit of a green tinge. Grass, unripe melon. Dry, but mellow. This wine feels and tastes like water at the tip of your tongue, then it picks up and shows flavours of wood and earth, but then it just disappears at the back."
143,Light yellow colour with green tint. Kiwi and asparges on the taste. Fresh taste. But I'm just not that into dry white Bordeaux.

151,Great Pessac with now 12 years of age. Don’t taste too cold. This wine has earned the right to the perfect tasting temperature. Hints of honey and grapefruit. Very rewarding and good value. Tasted in Hong Kong at Tin Lung Heen at the Ritz Carlton. Goes really well with Chinese food becaise it has depth. Really enjoyed.
152,Refreshing Bordeaux blanc that has some great citrus notes and an orange peel finish. It’s for a lovely buttery nose with a hint of dill herbs that I’m thinking would be a great accompaniment with some seafood

176,"A rich, round buttery aromas together with apricot, light touch of honey with medium acidity. Needs decanting"
177,"Was suprised by this white Bordeaux. The area pessac leognan with gravel and stone soil makes for fresh citrus, lemon grapefruit characteristics. This particular wine reminded me a little of home (new Zealand) with crisp acidity. Also some savoury notes on palate and nose - maybe the age..."
178,"Light blonde Color. Faint floral notes, slightly off balanced, splash of acidity with some fruit notes and some herbaceous and oaky hints. Med finish, decent but not a refreshing and complex wine which is what I expected for this classe."
179,this was pure poetry. you should not seek for tasting notes or other impressions you just have to meet this 30 year old Bordeaux Blanc. one of the reasons for which Bordeaux is the epicenter of the wine world is hidden in this bottle. spectacular experience. chapeau!
180,"Quite rich and full, nettles and smoky barrels. Good structure, not very exciting but rather enjoyable. A tangible bitterness brings down the mark a little."

206,"This 100% Sauvignon Blanc shows that this grape is much underestimated for aging. It is more than 20 years for this wine and it is very livelly. Aromas are fresh with gooseberry, blackcurrant leaves and some peaches. Taste is rich, zesty and livelly with high accidity and vanilla notes. I am sure it can go for 20 years more easily, of stored properly."
207,"93-95 points. Vintage 2020 en primeur opened in 2021. 👀The color is pale golden green. 👃The nose is offering white peach, oranges, and flowers. 👅The palate is offering citrus, peach, apricot, mango, apples, lemon and minerality. An initial sweetness, that highlights the delicate fruit and medium plus body. A medium plus acid that lingers on your palate. Long aftertaste. The nose is not as expressive as expected but the palate is classic and elegant. Beautiful wine. Long aging potential."
208,Love IT! But not for mussels...
209,Too much candied tropical fruit for me.
210,"Weak, tasteless, numb and overpriced"
211,Typical S. Blanc with scallop...
212,"Fermenter this, mofoooos"
213,Mooi
214,Helaas over de top
215,"4.1 вот сейчас оно на пике - сливочно-ванильное, скошенная трава, лимонные цукаты, все очень красиво и интересно"
216,"Dried fruit, apricot, sour cabbage, mineral, nuts. Elegant, old white Bordeaux. Well balanced and extremely pleasant."
217,Drank it with an 8 course meal and good company so might be biased but truly a lovely wine
218,"Very Light wine, ideal for lunch."
219,Underwhelming... was okay for the fish course but rather flat.....
220,"Really nicely aged white Bordeaux. Nose, fruity, pears, rich. Taste, well balanced fruity with hint of acidity, dry. Pears with hint of oak. Really delivered. Ate halibut with beetroots, potatoes and horseradish, a perfect match!"
221,Such a freshness for a Bordeaux dry white after 12 years ageing. A really good suprise
222,Fantastic Rich honeyed
223,"Understated and Stark, flint, oak, crisp, not much fruit left, whispers of citrus, good acidity"
224,Pale with high lemon acid
225,"Pale lemon Nose: herbaceous, grass, green pepper, lemon, wet stone, apple Flavour: lemon, lemon peel, grass Medium finish"
226,"Black-current, vanilla, excellent wine. Salmon tartar and this wine were an excellent pairing!"
227,"Great wine, fruity and with nice grapefruit flavors"
228,"Fruity, aromatic, strong for a white winw"
229,Wonderful woody notes
230,Good with pork. Nice fruity taste
231,Awesome aroma with floral finish
232,4.1. Very fresh Bdx Sauvignon.
233,Slick. Fresh. Citrus
234,This is magic. So tasteful and much fruit after 15 years. High acidity and long lasting aftertaste
235,Not worth the $30 price.
236,Very easy to drink. Hints of Apple. Needs about 30-50 mins to fully open
237,"Green Apple , lime, straw. Medium acidity, medium bodied. Good to drink now."
238,Good value for this relatively dry white wine. Subtle fruit flavours overtaken by a short acid after taste.
239,"A little pricier than usual, but recommended by an associate at Total Wine. Real rich with a softish finish."
240,Awesome!! I love this taste of sour and peach. I wanna run take raw fish such as Susi when I try to this Bordeaux.
241,"Le Nez: baked apple, grapefruit minor notes, toast vanilla; taste: baked apple pie with butter crumble on top. Amazing!"
242,"Sweet noise, dry finish. I got a hint of pineapple & light acidity."
243,Good for the price
244,"Fruity and dry but not acid, a fair value (KRW 50,000)"
245,"No assembly here, 100% sauvignon blanc. Very pleasant, complex, fruity. Better drink it fresh."
246,A stunner. Miles more interesting than most sauvignon
247,"Not fruity but interesting, good old vine, exelent dark yellow colour. Long taste and you wich to taste once more to analyse what taste there is. Very good!"
248,"Si je regrette une acidité un peu trop saillante et une finale en dessas, quelle aromatique par contre ! Pomme mûrs, miel, végétal, zeste d'orange, beurre, vanille, citron, abricot, fruits de la passion.... ça c'est typique des Pessac blanc et c'est bien gourmand 😋"
249,"Vintage 2000. Vooral heel spannend hoe een witte Bordeaux na al die jaren is. Of kan zijn. De geur is intrigerend, tegen het lastige aan. In de mond is er echt nog leven. De zuren zijn stevig maar er is ook nog fruit. Vooral een curiositeit."
250,"Too old for me. Smells rubbery, not nice. The taste is strange as well, woody but old. Not a fan at all."
251,Très beau nez sur les agrumes confits . Du gras en bouche avec une belle acidité et de très beaux amers en finale ! Très beau vin
252,One of my best white wines
253,Simply perfect for a sunday roast.
254,Smells like Eden Gardens!
255,Best one boum boum boum
256,"Fruity, citrus. Smooth. But don’t love it."
257,"Geur van passievrucht en kokos, toch heerlijk droog en mooie lange afdronk"
258,"Morze, kanalizacja."
259,Excellent sur huîtres en gelée et pan cota d'écrevisses et 2 saumons.
260,"Un cadeau qui réserve une belle surprise : bouchon à vis et je pensai le vin "" surfait "" ... des arômes confits de pommes.. une pointe d'acidite"
261,Første fadlagret Sauv. Blanc. jeg har smagt. Og må sige jeg er fan. En sprød vin med røget toner i rigtig god balance. Prisen ja det er jo Fransk.
262,"Kräftig gute Struktur voller Körper, ganz genial im Geschmack Waldbeeren Pflaumen mit Leder Pfeffer. Gut eingebundene Tannine sehr lange im Abgang."
263,1998ヴィンテージ。エノテカオンラインで購入。琥珀色。蜂蜜やナッツを思わせる香り、それに加えて酸味を予感させる香りも。シェリーっぽい感じ。アタックはキリッとした心地よい酸味があるがスッキリした感じ。中盤からすっきりハーブ系のニュアンスとナッツ様の香ばしいニュアンスが絶妙に膨らんでくる。その絡み合った複雑な旨みが長めの余韻を演出。開栓初日はワイン単体で飲む。
264,"Ganska kul vin. Doft: Marsipan, bivax, honung, russingnoch tuchpenna. Smak: annanas mango och exotiska frukter, medelsyra, Mandel, lätt oljigt och det unkna i en papya."
265,"Ароматика тонкая, цветы липы, лаванда и душица. Кислотность не агрессивна, сбалансированная, ваниль, сливки, объемность. В послевкусии твёрдое зеленое яблоко."
266,"Rigtig godt glas...Lækker sauvignon blanc, røget og med en del fadkarakter...Bag røgen kommer der noter af citrus, tropiske frugter - bestemt en anbefaling herfra"
267,"Интенсивность аромата ср+, спелый крыжовник, сливки, ваниль, тропики очень много, котики Кислотность ср+, сухое, алкоголь средний, тело ср+, послевкусие ср+. Очень хорошо. "
268,"F gulgrønn N krutt, våt stein, sitrusskall, integrert fat/smør, gule epler M høy syre, bra fyldig og god inngang; lett bitterhet i finish. Mye samme i munnen som på nesen. Lang. Flott vin 90 p"
269,"Heerlijk zeg en heel speciaal! 100 % sauvignon blanc uit Bordeaux. Deze 2005 open gedaan in 2020 en Oelala! Heerlijk in de neus, de smaak en een super lange afdronk! Toppertje!"
270,Superbe blanc de Pessac Léognan affichant beaucoup de fraicheur des notes d’agrumes et de fruits jaunes
271,God vit bourgogne med både toner av gul och grön frukt. God till grillad fisk med en fräsch röra av gula äpplen och lite mango och lime. Varför inte slänga med lite koriander också för att matcha det gröna i vinet
272,"butter vanilla oak grapefruit grass minerals 이 와인은 나에겐 아직 더 열려야했었다. 산미도 강하고 복합적인 맛이 나를 끝까지 혼란스럽게 했다. 물론 이때쯤 취하고 있었고, 마지막 한모금까지 느껴보려 나오면서 한입 또 넣어보았다. 기억엔 뒤로 갈수록 좋았다는 것! 그리고 너무 칠링을 많이 해서 마실 필요가 없을 와인같다고 느꼈다. 시간을 두고 변화를 충분히 느끼면서 즐겼으면 더 좋았을 와인! 아쉽다는 느낌을 뒤로 하고 다음을 기약해본다."
273,"Deilig moden, kompleks og harmonisk! Lys gulgrønn. Frisk og kompleks nese med innslag av flint, røyk, høy, bivoks, moden sitron og hint av eik og steinfrukt. Mye av det samme går igjen i munnen, med noe mer gul frukt (gul kiwi?) og salt mineralitet. Lang ettersmak av salt, moden frukt og moderat syre. Helt optimal nå! Mine fordommer om skrukork blir fullstendig gjort til skamme. 4-4,5."
274,"Arrivato al termine nel senso che o lo bevo sta sera o se no non so quanto tempo ancora possa restare in se questi Sauvignon Blanc stupisce, grande naso leggera nota ossidativi che non disturba, in bocca avvolge e persiste a lungo! ottimo vino"
275,"Très beau vin où l'on sent que l'année à été ensoleillé puisqu'il possède du corps mais heureusement que l'acidité est là pour rééquilibrer ce vin. C'est un vin qui je pense ne pourra pas être conservé plus de 10 ans alors que dans les millésimes plus frais il peut se garder des décennies! Pour ceux qui sous estimait les vins blancs bordelais, goûter celui-ci et vois changerez d'avis!"
276,"Sa couleur en trompera plus d’un. Car, si le premier regard échangé fait plutôt dans la nuance, c’est au premier nez, comme à la première bouche, que le festival prend corps. Agrumes, fleurs blanches, belle acidité en équilibre... tout n’est que surprise. Surprise ensoleillée, même. C’est vif. Poudré vanille. Jusqu’à cette teinte citronnée, vite rattrapée en finale par une superbe glisse minérale. Du bel ouvrage à partager sur un joli filet de merlu blanc ou dos de bar rôti."
277,"3,75 -89 poeng. Lukket på duft. Trenger tid. Lime, stikkelsbær , litt voks og tre. Medium + lengde. Mulig den trenger noen år til på langs. Drukket til reker i Zalto universal. For all del en god vin, men ikke verdt prisen (390kr)."

336,"4.25: Superbe Blanc. très expressif au nez, arôme puissant sur fruit de la passion, côté vanillé du bois bien fondu. Très bonne tenue, pas de trace de cheveux gris malgré les 7 ans au compteur. En bref: beaucoup de plaisir, merci la vie !"
337,3.7 透明感、輝きのある濃いめの黄色。ディスク中程度。青リンゴ、オレンジ、ハーブや草。ドライ。酸味ハイ。ミディアムボディ。青リンゴなどのフレッシュな果実味と藁や草などややスモーキーな味わいが調和している。ミネラル感もしっかり感じる。青リンゴが一番の特徴。10度前後の温度が良いと思う。３日経っても問題なく飲める。
338,Fantastij balanserad soft och en smak son sitter länge I munnen.
339,スッキリしつつも、グッと攻めてくる感じで。カベルネなのかと、後から感じる。スクリューキャップで、耐える熟成なのかしら。

341,"Grapefrukt, stikkelsbær og hylleblomst på duft. Fint fatpreg. Frisk smak med bra syre. Mineralsk med lang finish."
342,美味
343,GT Nez typique. Bouche agréable entre notes de fruits et de végétaux. Ca démarre bien mais la chaleur en finale est pas glop. Peut-être bu trop tiède
344,"C’est bon, frais, mais sans la longueur et la complexité attendu d’un cru classé. J’ai de bien meilleurs souvenirs sur d’autres millésimes."
345,"Robe dorée intense, arômes fruités, agrumes, en bouche vin vif avec une belle acidité. Belle matière et bonne persistance. Vraiment sympa."
346,"Ett 100% SB vin vilket tydligt visar sig i både doft och smak. Druvtypisk med fläder, citrus, buxbom och en syra som sitter kvar behaglig länge."
347,Trevlig ek bra syra blommig mineral vingummi aceton bäst efter luftning
348,"Les classiques ça a du bon. Le fiston a adoré ce bel équilibre de franche acidité en début de bouche et une longueur phénoménale bien crémée. De l'ananas, du kumquat, bien évidemment un peu de vanille. Belle explosion en bouche. Un grand plaisir sur des St Jacques achetées fraîches sur le marché."
349,Sitrus og smør.

351,"Super et atypique Capsule à vis - à la fois très jeune et évolué - à carafer Sauvignon sur le fil de la maturité, très puissant avec tension et concentration Nez très expressif arômes verts de plantes médicinales, et de citron, de pamplemousse. En bouche à la fois vif et plein/rond, du croquant de pomme verte, finale salivante. Super sur plats gras, crustacés, fromages, desserts de fruits"
352,"Gereifter weißer Pessac-Léognan, dessen dunkles Goldgelb alleine schon bezaubert. In der Nase Honig, Bienenwachs, Steinobst, Heustadl und überreife Ananas, am Gaumen trocken mit glatter Textur, altersmilder Säure, einem Hauch Bratapfel und etwas Rancio. Feiner Wein!"

370,a differencier d 1 bon chardonnay par le nez aromatique et l absence de beurre. Ca remplit les joues et c est hyper agrėable!
371,"Nez sur les agrumes, amande, en bouche une belle matière et bonne longueur. Un 100% sauvignon des plus agréables."
372,"Un splendide vin, bien équilibré, du gras de l'acidité du fruit (pêche abricot sur l'agrume aussi), un réel plaisir, j'y reviendrai."
373,"Flott og frisk! Veldig floralsk på nesen. Grapefrukt, fersken, smør og eik. God syre i avslutningen."
374,Minerals
375,"Drukket på ToppHvitt 2019 i regi av Kapitalvin på Design og Arkitekturhøyskolen torsdag 25.april. Fantastisk event, stort utvalg og høy kvalitet. Egne smakskommentarer kommer ikke."
376,自宅にて開栓。 3.7ポイント。 2005ヴィンテージ。 2015が1976のベンリアックに似ていたクーアン・リュルトンの1995。 オイリーな樽感がホグスヘッドのベンリアックっぽいし桃感もそれを彷彿させるが、2015と比べて熟成による複雑みが増している。 スクリューキャップで保管が楽なのもあるが、数日で豊かな酸が果実味を際立たせている。 素晴らしいペサック・レオニャンの白。

386,Godt å se god hvitvin fra Bordeaux!
387,"Frisk omogen frukt, citrus. Välbalanserad syra."
388,Kompleks og tropisk Sauvignon Blanc fra bourdeaux. Artig. Mer i retning av mango og ananas.
389,"Nez fermé (cuir) belle acidité en bouche, pierre a fusil (silex), fumé. Sauvignon 100% !"
390,Blomster og urter! God balanse og sødme!
391,밸런스 좋고 우아하지만 뭔가 특색은 부족한 느낌.. 가격에 비해 그만한 역할은 못해주는 듯
392,"Nydelig hvit Bordeaux. Gul frukt mot tropisk, mineralsk, herlig syre"
393,"Nez typique d'un sauvignon élevé sous bois. Envoûtant. En bouche, l'attaque est très acide et domine trop largement. Avec un peu de patience, on retrouve la rondeur et le doux boisé vanillé du vin accompagnant notre homard breton."
394,"Nuance jaune citron reflet jaune pâle Olfactif fruit tropical, végétale, fleurs blanche Gustatif attaque net dominante acidulé évolution fraiche suave ample Arôme légèrement fumé Persistance longue Consommé maintenant jusqu'à 2034 Accord Tartare de saumon citron St jacques"
395,"Nez exhubérant allant chercher du côté des fruits exotiques : mangue et surtout fruit de la passion. Bouche manquant de relief, on s'attendant à plus au vue du nez. Boisé discret. Vin tout de même intéressant."
396,"Vinen er kraftig og kompleks på duft. Gummi, krutt og svovel som fremstår litt vulgært. På smak er det mye syre og noe som ligner på leverpostei. Jeg har aldri forstått hvit Bordeaux og ei heller prisingen på dette. 83 poeng."
397,"Разочаровало. Ничем не выделялось рядом с новосветскими образцами, довольно скромные характеристики чтобы переплачивать втрое относительно нового света. Цветы, мед, сливки, неплохо но резковато. Возможно ожидания были завышены. 87-88."
398,Nous arrivons à la limite de ce qu’il peut donner. Les arômes de fruits secs et à coques sont encore présents mais la fin de bouche est assez courte et le vin est quelque peu oxydé. Ne pas attendre donc
399,"Неплохой, но уж слишком простой, если не примитивный, для Бордо СБ. Чёрная смородина, манго, маракуйя (это если поискать) - и всё время оочень рядом торчат кошачьи уши.😁 Гладкий вкус без сюрпризов и претензий. Исключительно под гастрономию - 3,6.."

423,"3,0 Kan slet ikke finde faglagringen i smagen, som så også er for skarp og unuanceret og uden meget frugt."
424,"Till pastan med sockerärtor, vårlök, estragon, smör, äggula, citron och 50 grader laxloin mötte den upp bra med en mogen fyllighet och en förvånansvärt lång syra i eftersmaken. Påminde lite om torr vit sherry. Till osten som var en Österrikisk weinkäse uppträdde den som ett artig dessertvin med smak av gula russin, mogen exotisk frukt och väldigt låg syra. När osten var slut kom lite av syran tillbaka."
425,"Per chi non conosce il Bordeaux bianco, questo è un ottimo esempio. Molto brillante, ottima acidità nonostante i suoi 14 anni. Attraente e peculiare al naso, con sentori delicati di frutta estiva, pesche e albicocche con ben integrata vaniglia. Complessità persistente al palato associata a un piacevole senso rinfrescante. Un bianco che si distingue pur con classe. Complimenti a Lurton..."
426,"Au nez, citron confit, encostique En bouche super longueur, quelle équilibre !! On se réconcilie avec les grands bordeaux !!"
427,"Det här var udda. Kan inte bestämma mig för om jag gillar det eller inte. Det första jag tänker på när jag doftar är gummi. Oväntad doft. Sen känner jag fatade toner och exotiska frukter. Smaken är smörig och oljig med vanilj, lite lime och mango, papaya, ananas. Mer intressant än njutbart."
428,"Vin dégusté avec bouchon liège et bouchon vis. Côté liège : nez citron jaune frais à confit avec le bois qui apparaît après agitation. Côté assez oléagineux. En bouche bonne acidité, fruit de la passion en arrière bouche. Côté vis : nez fumé, pas très précis (réduction qui s’atténue avec l’agitation). Fruits confits et cacahuète après agitation. Un côté fruité se retrouve plus en bouche. Manque de précision en général"
