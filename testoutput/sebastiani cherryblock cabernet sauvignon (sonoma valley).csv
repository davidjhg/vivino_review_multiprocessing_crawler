0,One of the Best cabs in the game bar none
1,"2010 still great in 2021. Lots of cherry, black cherry with hints of vanilla on the end. Not quite as good as 2013 but well worth the wait."
2,"Excellent wine. The tobacco lingers a bit at the back of the tongue, making the wine seem bold while sweet for a cab. Loved it. Such a treat."
3,This is by far my favorite wine! Great bold flavors blackberries and much more. One of a kind. If you love Cabernets this is a must.
4,Bold cherry red!
5,This was one of the most unique Cabs I have tried. Super smooth with almost no tannins.
6,Deep color. Dry. Hints of oak and the perfect sweet and bold balance. A very good red.
7,"Amazing smell, bold taste, best wine I've had!"
8,Great winery and wonderful body to this wine. cherry oak dried roses
9,Celebrated my 50th with this wine! Every sip was amazing!
10,"Dry, red and fine taste bold wine."
11,Best wine I‚Äôve had to date. Bold and a bit on dryer side. Excellent flavors.
12,"Black cherry, cherry and other red fruit flavor are incredibly strong and persistent in this wine. E joyed every sip"
13,"Very cherry, fruity,"
14,"This wine never fails to impress. Aromas are blackberry, cassis and cherry. Flavors are blackberry, mild cassis, cherry and mild oak toast. Late in day so likely missing some nuance."
15,The very best Cabernet from Sebastiani! Honestly for the price I would suggest 2016 Cabernet or Old VineCabernet and buy2-3 times as many bottles!
16,"Birthday #wine fruit forward with black cherry plum light spice med-full body light tannins, just a wonderful wine @cherryblock @sebastianiwine"
17,Mixed berry pie. Black cherry. Wet leaves. Stone. Dried chili pepper. Oregano. A sharp nose and smooth fruity palate. Delicious!
18,Strawberry cherry other dark fruits. Don't know how else to describe it but this is phenomenal. Favorite from California from large production.
19,"Delicious complete wine that is well balanced in flavors. Nice acidity with touches of leather, lavender, and sarsaparilla on top of other flavors."
20,Incredible. Giving this 5 stars was easy. No need to elaborate. So glad I have more than 1 bottle so I can try again when it matures a bit more. Amazing cab.
21,"Creamy luscious cherries and black currant on the nose, kiss of vanilla, on the palate you get juicy raspberries and red plum. Structure is tart but light."
22,"Now this is a wine! Cherry on the nose, surprise pop of pepper in the middle, soft and long finish, perfect medium tannins. Will she well for many years."
23,The cherry infused richness from hundreds years past cherry orchard terroir on this single vineyard cab now make the block a unique and classic wine for Napa lovers.
24,"Excellent bottle after let it breath for at least half hour black currant good complexity cherry and strawberry, lemon. Ruby color spicy and smooth long finish"
25,"Very very good. Licorice on the nose. I would decant it for a good long time - found the tannins too strong to start with, but with time it was much smoother. Great with ribeye."
26,Really amazing wine! I was very impressed with the weight and the fruit. There is definitely a hint of cherry and some tobacco. A little pricey but I think it's worth it.
27,"A well aged wine brings comfort and deliciousness like this 2002 Cabernet with concentrated fruits of blackberries, cherries and plum with underlying flavors of licorice, black currant, spices and well-developed berry aromas that adds maturity and depth. Wonderful!"
28,"Black berries and olives. This wine is now 17 years old, almost legal! was a great experience. A classic sonoma cab. Great ruby color that aged well over the years. Biggest complaint is finding this vintage again may be real hard. Party like its 1999!"
29,"Dark magenta colour after resting 4 years since purchasing. Huge vanilla, cherry wood, leather and some blackberry notes. Legs that are slow to develop and slowly droop on glass enticing you. Smoother than silk on palate after being laid down with dark fruit, dark chocolate, leather, straw, and a dry oak finish. Outstanding and will get better yet."
30,"Translucent plum hue. A extraordinary nose of musty cedar chest, black walnut, tobacco, and drying leather. Black currant, clove, lavender entangled with dried dark fruit, hazelnut, and fig. This is an astonishing wine that is ready, but willing to wait. Don‚Äôt tell Napa but this Sonoma jewel would rival their very best! 96 points."
31,"Rich, vanilla and maybe just a slight hint of pepper? Very very smooth, probably because it was aged well and fairly complex. This is a heavy big wine so have to let it breathe, especially after 11 years. Only downside was I was just expecting a little extra? Probably being unfair. Had at Eddies house"
32,"2001 vintage 100th anniversary wine since Sebastianis first vintage in 1901. Color is medium ruby Nose had red licorice, leather, truffle, Raspberry and mocha. Palate had vanilla and black Raspberry. Tannins are youthful and the wine hs great balance. Delicious now but has many years ahead. One of the best older wines I've tried. Cheers."
33,"The Cherryblock vineyard Cab Sauv at the estate in Sonoma has been a favorite since our first visit to the winery in 1998. Dark rich berries, blackberry, black cherry, plum , blackcurrant, chocolate, baking spice and something earthy. Love this wine though there are many that are as good for 1/2 the price I guess what‚Äôs special is the history and small production. Had with rib eye for Father‚Äôs Day. Like the 20% off to non club members and free shipping too!"
34,"Tasted and bought at todays top USA mini Tasting at Zweifel. This wine has a nice ruby red, nose full of red and black fruits, smoke. On the palate silky and fine, full bodied, elegant and long, elder, cherries and plum, vanilla, smoke. A light sweetness, wonderful wine and and save for next 5-10 years! Interesting discovery, but the price is ""too high"" üòéüëçüèªüç∑"
35,"Plum jam, blueberries, creme de cassis and a tad smoke and earthy loam. Nice surprise indeed. A real mouthfeel!!! Super smooth tasty finish. High praise!!"
36,Oh. My. God. This is heaven. So much blackberry. Peppery finish. Watery up front with a fantastic bold finish.
37,"Outstanding! ""Cherry""block isn''t just a name. This is a huge cherry bomb. Big up front and long finish with toasty plum and cherry flavors."
38,"Amazing bottle of full bodied velvet. The flavors are so heavily layered it almost feels thick to drink. A little sweeter than I thought, will be good for years to come."
39,"Rich cab, long and complex, fabulous with steak. KK: Not too strong on the nose. Holds up to the flavorful ribeye well."
40,"In this Magnum you can really appreciate this wine, 4.8‚≠êÔ∏è"
41,Not even here two hours...never bought Sebastiani before but the Cherryblock rocks! Thanks Penny
42,"A-ma-zing. I love an oaky wine and this does not disappoint. Rich, smooth, and velvety."
43,Black cherry and blackberry are present with a subtle tannic after tone Wonderful finish. Outstanding vintage. Will age wonderfully. Great wine
44,First time drinking the Cherry Block. Really nice!
45,Had as an extra at a tasting. Spectacular
46,Yea It is that good!! 95 pts
47,No one can beat Cherryblock from Sonoma- this wine over delivers!
48,Deep ruby with dark berry taste. Rich and smooth.
49,"Plum, cherry, and oak! Lots of layers. A sharp, tannic finish."
50,Round and tart. Cherries and cherries.
51,Amazing Cab. Like no other I have tried.
52,"Excellent elegant cab! Rich deep red color, nice nose. Smooth finish, really no tannins. Hints of blackberry, dark cherry. Great with a nice ribeye steak."
53,The best cab out there
54,This is a thoroughbred. A wonderful cab. Great balance. Mild black cherry yields to modest earthy finish with no tannins. Wonderfully smooth; easy to drink. A winner. J
55,"Light, fruit forward, great early dinner wine"
56,"Lovely oak and leather in nose, absolutely lovely legs, well-balanced tannins and oak in palate with dry finish and dark berries in aftertaste. Lovely!"
57,A mix of red berries with a little tartness. Also some wet soil-minerally finish. Medium body. Well balance tanins. Liked the wine. The price not so much.
58,"90's American Wine Night promoted by Vaocubo Blog - vaocubo.com. El Tranvia Itaim, December 5. Third place of the night, generous aromas of vanilla and red fruits, elegant on mouth. Rate 4.5"
59,"Super smooth, however it needs to breathe"
60,Wow! I have been looking forward to trying this one. This wine has some heft with the perfect balance of blackberry and vanilla with a touch of tartness. This is fantastic!
61,Light fruit with a slightly dry finish. So easy to drink. Excellent right out of the bottle!
62,Absolutely awesome cab. Been sitting in my basement for 5 years and today is my anniversary so my wife and I decided to celebrate considering the times we are in now and enjoy this really nice bottle of wine with filet mignon steak. The wine is very smooth with dark fruit cherries and some earthy tones. Definitely one of the better wines I ever had.
63,"Lovely earthy and spice notes on the nose. More earth and spice on the tongue, complemented by leather notes. Tannic on the finish. Parches just a little bit and is very dry, but totally worth it. Lovely plum color on the body."
64,"This wine is outstanding! Dark fruits, chocolate and sweet oak."
65,"Wow! This is a Stella cab sauv. I seriously didn‚Äôt know I had something this good sitting in the wine fridge. Kudos to me!! Bold and subtle, fruit but dry this is simply a solid drop. A little surprised on the amount of sediment already but great flavor with a smoke cherry note. So good"
66,"92. PnP'd. Big fruit, with vanilla, tobacco, leather and plum. Nose and mid palate are terrific. Nice finish and slightly try. Drinking well but I believe it will be excellent in another 2 years. Wish we had time to decant this one but we will be grabbing up a few for sure!"
67,"Wow, what a nose! Cherries, blackberries, clove, cedar, and maybe eucalyptus. In a nice place right now - tannins are silky smooth and the finish is long and elegant. Great value from a solid, historic producer."
68,"2016 - Great nose on this one, abundant with red fruit, oak, coffee and baked plum. Soft and smooth through the palate, drinking great now. Mineral notes, blackberry and vanilla finish it off. 4.45* RP94"
69,"Very smooth, high quality Cab that would appeal to people who aren‚Äôt usually Cab fans. Medium intensity aromas of black cherry, minerals, plum, cassis. Medium-dark ruby in color. Medium-heavy body, low-med acidity, medium tannins that are VERY smooth. Flavors of black cherry, vanilla, oak, plum, raspberry, blackcurrant, blackberry, blueberry, dark chocolate."
70,"Dark fruit, blackberry jam, soft vanilla and oak on the nose. Blackberries, black cherry and black tea on the palate. Gripping tannins lead to a long finish."
71,"It‚Äôs a good wine...black fruit notes with a blend of some red fruit notes as well...nice balance...not as smooth as I wld of expected, tannins were mild."
72,"Big fruit, big tannins, big long finish. This is as good as Diamond Creek!!!dark black color. Wonderful!!!"
73,Black currant with hints of chocolate. Dynamite.
74,2010 is Absolutely delicious after decanting for an hour or so Delicious dark fruits with some light chocolate. Wonderful nose and long finish
75,"Excellent bouquet, fruity, wonderful balance and finish. Medium body Cabernet.Would be great with beef or pork. Not strong enough for lamb."
76,Wow Bird and I had on our first trip to Sonoma and loved it a few years ago Just had again Holy shit Amazing
77,"‚Äò15 Raspberry and licorice on the nose. Booming cherry after about 90 minutes decanted. Extended, delicious finish."
78,As always... A super excelent wine!!! A very fine Cab! Elegant and round.
79,Just drink it. Amazing ‚ô•Ô∏è
80,Greg‚Äôs in Dallas
81,Happy 25th!! Ca‚Äô Bianca in Santa Rosa for this magnificent celebration!!
82,Excellent smooth dirt cherry great with Spinalis (on top of rib eye) at Cuvee Destin
83,"Smooth, very good!"
84,"Nice, but need a little more bottle age."
85,Tasteful black cherry
86,(4.4*) Evento do Blog Vaocubo no El Tranvia do Itaim com vinhos americanos da d√©cada de 90.
87,Needs decanting but worth the wait def a wine by the glass wine.
88,Wow I fell in love
89,Cherry fruit aromas! Very nice integration of oak tannins. Fantastic wine! One of my favorites!
90,Very complex Simply fabulous
91,Heavenly smooth and deep. Luscious and ready to drink.
92,"Already starting to turn. Brownish color, but still not too bad. A little vinegary, but after an hour or so it drinks okay. A little dusty, with cherry, tobacco, and oak flavors."
93,Just seeing the color and taking in the nose I was excited to sip this. The nose just felt balance with good black fruit character. On the palate the balance was so inviting. Dark blackberry and black cherry with a toasted oak and a slight tobacco quality.
94,"Sebastiani Cherryblock 2002 ""Mineral, bold black fruits, cedar, creamy, chocolate, smooth tannins, full bodied, medium finish."" WC 94 Points Date tasted 2.7.25 Drink now through 2021 Price: $70 Alc: 14.4% Varietal: Cabernet Sauvignon Distributed by Mendez & Company"
95,"Bright and juicy Cab! deep ruby color; on the nose dark cherry, teaberry, menthol, leather, talc and spice; on the palate medium+ body, medium+ acidity, round; flavors of black cherry, root beer, minerality and tobacco; fine grained tannins; pair with Honey Baked Ham. 91+ pts"
96,"So we failed miserably! We tried really hard but our dry January is over. How can you eat a nice filet steak and not have a glass of red to wash it down? Wine was very good, fruit forward but still some depth. Not sure I would buy it again but still after 18 days without wine it was very very nice!"
97,"Such a deep red! So seductive in the glass, with dark berry and cedar nose. The deep berries continue with the in the mouth and lead to rich fruit flavors and firm tannins. Doesn't get much better for a cab!"
98,"Wow, ""cherry"" block is right. Very very cherry, thin, dry. The bottle I tried had quite a bit of sediment. Not sure if that is to be expected."
99,"Big wine, slow to sip, pretty purple/dark red color, taste a slight tart cherry although flavors vary throughout the sip. Very smooth. Not your typical cab!! Way better :) I‚Äôm not a cab person"
100,"Cherry block simply never disappoints. Love the oak overtones, a little cedar. A vanillin sweetness hits the tongue followed by cherry, black cherry notes and a hint of spice."
101,Amazing tannins and delicious fruit.
102,"An excellent wine. You get a little bit of vanilla, good red fruit flavor. Good peppery warmth as well."
103,Has that bold Aroma of a full cab - but finishes really smooth with hints of a woody almost soft tobacco base. The best wine I've had this year - full disclosure this is about double the $ I normally drink - gift - love my friends! Would pay for this bottle again.
104,Outstanding wine! I just had a bottle from 1999 with friends last night and except for a very dry cork the wine did not disappoint! Full black cherry on the nose with hints of chocolate ! Absolutely smooth and outstanding!!
105,Drinking beautifully. Aged very nicely
106,Wonderful wine. For grownups
107,"Deep notes of cherry, smooth, oaky, love it!"
108,I hear that this is a really old vineyard with old vines. Some cherry.
109,"Very nice. Light on tannins, easy drinking. Full bodied, luscious mouth feel. Dark cherry..."
110,Great and going strong
111,"A really great wine. it needed to becanted for about an hour ahead of time. Smooth, great nose. Perfect! Thanks Pat and Harvey."
112,"Their best cab, top of the line Sebastiani at its best!"
113,"Chocolate, cherry, amd full body. Quite the delicious pour"
114,One of the smoothest cabs I've tasted...deep cherry bouquet makes for an excellent way to spend your Saturday night!
115,"Wonderful quality of the grape comes through... brambles, vanilla... delicious and velvety texture."
116,"One the the best wines I have ever got my hands on! Smooth dark cherry greatness, with a long plum attitude finish!"
117,5 stars does not do this wine justice. I would rate a 10 if possible. One if the best wines I've ever drank.
118,'12 & '13 are amazing. Fell in love with Sebastiani this month when we were in Sonoma for my birthday. Cheers..
119,Very nice cab. Nice on the nose. Smooth and rich. Not too heavy on tannins. Rich notes of dark fruit on the palate.
120,Dark Ruby in colour aromas of dark to black cherries cranberry and cassis the flavours are bold lncluding black cherry on first taste the finish is lengthy with cola berry and vanilla medium bodied the wine closes with smooth tannins and a nice acidity great just alone but with roast bbq beef also
121,Smooth and fruity
122,Holy yum. Thick and delicious
123,"Supereleganter, filigraner Napa-Cab"
124,"Juicy, tart, dry finish"
125,Holy moley! This thing was in perfect condition. The fruit was still present but shows notes of leather and tobacco and old book pages. What a treat! Still singing of tart cherry.
126,"Just amazing. Cab with perfect blend of fruit, tannin and oak"
127,"A lovely, well balanced wine. Long lasting on the palate, if not incredibly complex."
128,Sweet. Wonderfully refreshing
129,All time favorite
130,Dark ruby red color....very velvety taste...some tannins in taste.....good wine
131,"Very smooth, great length and red fruit flavors. A little too smooth for me, and expensive."

151,Even better than the 2008.
152,"Smooth, smooth, smooth thru past finish"
153,Delicious in a word. Rich with hints of cherry.
154,One of the best cabs I‚Äôve ever had!
155,"Dark chocolate, smoky notes. Smooth and delicious"
156,"Big legs, strong but smooth cab. Great wine but maybe not for the price."
157,"Light hints if cherry, fruity but mild. Has a bite but not too dry. Highly recommended!"
158,Very round and balanced
159,"An elegant Cabernet, smooth and pleasing on the palate"
160,Very smooth full bodied cab. Excellent.

163,"Great taste, fruity, slitly dry, great fr that special occasion!"
164,Gigi Christmas gift. So smooth no weird aftertaste. Amazing.
165,Rich in berry flavor and deliciously smooth.

167,"Sumptuous smooth tannins and deep black fruit with hints of leather, cocoa and cedar."
168,Best wine I tasted in Napa or Sonoma
169,"Very smooth cab, not typical Sonoma. More in the style of Staggs Leap District, Napa."
170,Very drinkable already but will likely age as well. Amazing.
171,Delicious right out of the bottle. No decanting needed!
172,One of the best Sonoma cabs I‚Äôve had. Hands down
173,This in an impeccable cab. Red current and plum notes with a peppery finish. Smooth and flavors of dark rich fruit remain on the tongue begging for another sip :)
174,Just ok. A lot better wines for this price.
175,They had a buttery Chardonnay that was delish!
176,One of the smoothest cabs I have had to date. Cherry and oak with hints of earthy gravel. Full bodied and very rich fruit flavors I image this will remain the same through 2028
177,"Concentrated chocolate and liquorice spice. Strong core of dark red fruits, cloves and beefy tannin.Still youthful but drinking seriously well now if you don‚Äôt mind a bit of chewiness. Boom! Love it!"
178,"Amazing wine with a smooth, subtle cherry essence that makes it the most incredible wine."
179,"Allspice, Cigar box, lovely finish"
180,"A very good cab. Not as full bodied as some that I enjoy but very balanced and smooth. Decanting not needed. Open, drink and enjoy."
181,Decanted for 1 hour
182,"Big fruit bomb! A little tannic right now, but plenty of luscious raspberry and apple cider pouring through, and a lingering finish."
183,"Very good wine. Smooth and low tannins, but not as much fruit as the Dunn‚Äôs or J D Danials"
184,Took a good friend out who loves Sebastiani Zinfandel. We loved this special 2015 cab Sav It has the complete range of bursting flavours in the palate. Leaves a long ripe cherry bouquet as you savor the fragrance of this complete red wine.
185,"A lot of fruit on the front end and settles into a velvety, ruby red wine. Doesn't live up to the price but a great 4+ wine nonetheless... Gimme $30 back and you get 5 stars from me. Cheers!"
186,Expected a little more action.
187,Really really one of the driest reds I have tasted surprised me was well cellared. Flavor was subtle.
188,We love Sebastiani and based on the reviews we were expecting a WOW moment but unfortunately it fell short of about everything. It was good but not worth the price. I hope we had the bad apple.
189,Another amazing aged wine.
190,Chewy. Dark purple. Sweet start nice finish.

199,Oh yes!!! Pair this baby with a ribeye steak ... Mmmmmm!
200,"Very nice wine, well balance. cherry oak blackberry. But, it's little too expensive."
201,Very smooth with lovely notes of oak and cherry.
202,Wagyu beef steak dinner and Cherryblock 2012 is heaven.
203,Superb. Silky smooth. Wish I had more.
204,"Smooth, but full bodied. Actually a cab blend with 12% merlot and 3% Malbec... worth the price!"
205,"Great, light red, tannins"

207,Great wine even better since I drank it for free
208,Full flavor yet light in taste
209,Fabulous bouquet...excellent raspberry tones.
210,"Full bodied, big and bold. A bottle that's takes time to drink and with time it's gets better"
211,One of my favorites. Great with steaks and special occasions.
212,"It Is Quite Yummy!!! Very Smokey, Chocolatey, Tobaccoie"
213,Best Cabernet I‚Äôve ever had.
214,Amazing wine can‚Äôt wait to taste it 10 years from now.

216,"Very smooth, bold fruits, nice finish and not dry at all for a cab."
217,"Had Cherryblock (don‚Äôt recall the vintage) for the first time at the winery and loved it so much so I joined their club. Opened a bottle for a special occasion last night and wasn‚Äôt as impressed. We still enjoyed the bottle, but neither one of us had an OMG experience."
218,Totally underwhelmed by this wine given its reputation and price point. I expected much more. Thin with a harsh finish.
219,One of my favorites! Not available in stores. Can only get through the winery.
220,Deep & soft taste. Great price !
221,Over a little... But nice
222,Nice full bodied cab
223,Will drink this wine in 2020. Bought for special occasion. Has very good referrals.
224,Very good but not a 5 star wine. Lovely finish but something was just not 100%
225,Has a smokey flavor that makes it a little more bold
226,Rich fruity notes and very soft finish
227,Damn....this is good

242,"Degusta√ß√£o americanos d√©cada de 90! Esse vinho que se mostrou bem opulento abocanhou a medalha de bronze da noite! Mostrou cor granada profundo e nariz efusivo em aromas de frutas vermelhas e negras maduras, em compota, notas de ervas, trufas, madeira seca e tabaco. Em boca tem corpo m√©dio, acidez m√©dia e √°lcool presente sem agredir. Os taninos eram bem maduros e suculentos e os sabores evolu√≠dos com forte express√£o das frutas, das ervas e notas derivadas da madeira. O final √© longo e delicioso. Especial!"

323,One of the Best cabs in the game bar none
324,"2010 still great in 2021. Lots of cherry, black cherry with hints of vanilla on the end. Not quite as good as 2013 but well worth the wait."
325,"Excellent wine. The tobacco lingers a bit at the back of the tongue, making the wine seem bold while sweet for a cab. Loved it. Such a treat."
