28,A great full mature complex Bordeaux that kept a kick of youth and is not as boring as many new Bordeaux wines - subtle and gentle
29,Finally tried a 2010 after many 2011. A wine that can shine and excites my palate. Approachable now but will continue to improve for the next 5 years.
30,Superb power and full body. Just beginning to really reveal itself. Still young but lots of more earthy flavours beginning to develop. Drunk alongside a wonderful entrecôte.
31,"💥 This is a cracking Pessac-Leognan for £59 in a top vintage that's great to drink now & will evolve into a 5⭐️ beauty in 5-10 years 👍 🍇 65% Cab S, 20% Mer & 5% Pet V 🍷Dark ruby red 👃 Gravel, mineral, earthy, tobacco, wet leaves, pencil lead, mocha, plummy & dark berry - yummy! 👄 Soft warming super silky medium body of mocha driven stewed dark plum/berry 🎯 Long dirty earthy soft mocha dark plum slight sweet drying finish"
32,"When tasting bordeaux blind, first thing is to identify the left bank (cab sav - green bell pepper) or right bank (merlot - black plums) character. When a wine divides a group, it often turns out to be a left bank with higher merlot content (Pichon Lalande, Palmer). This one didn't quite have that quality level so it could be many things. Dried blackberry, roasted spice, light earthiness and a soft mature palate. Classic consistent bordeaux at a fair price. (Blend had 40% merlot so we weren't too far off)."
33,"This is a fantastic example of pessac-leognan Blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, merlot, Cabernet franc and petit Verdot , aged for 18months where partially in new French oak Appearance:deep ruby red in colour Nose:very attractive and expressive bouquet ( aromas of red fruits, dark fruits, liquorice) Palate: it has a silky texture, soft polished tannins, moderate acidity, concentrated notes of red and dark cherries, cassis, liquorice, sweet oak Length:very persistent length"

35,"Region: Pessac-Leognan Grape Variety: Bordeaux Blend Red ABV: 13.5% Stopper: Cork Full bodied red wine. Ruby red with violet reflections in colour, on the nose, aromas of cassis and plum with notes of spices. Medium tannins. Well-balanced in acidity. Savory and classic red wine in style.

It's elegance are praised by the black fruit perfume, sweet spice, very smooth tannins, medium bodied. Fine wine indeed! For anyone who enjoy drinking fine mature wines, look no further. As you probably won't find a better wine within this price range. A wine that you would bring to a fancy wine gathering!! Absolutely beautiful!"
38,"First Bordeaux in a while to truly dazzle me! The nose is so beautifully displayed; currants, truffles, creme de cassis, pencil shavings, licorice and hints of strawberries. The tannins are there but they are gentle and sweet; fruitdriven yet so refined! Cassis, blackcurrants, vanilla, lead, cedar and lush ripe plums. This is already a dream and will be a blast for decades!"
39,"Blend of 65% Cab Sauvignon, 30% Merlot & 5% Petite Verdot. A wonderful wine with ripe fruit, floral and spice aromas. Cherry, plum and currant flavors with a nice mineral edge, creamy soft tannins, lingering finish ending with a earthy mineral tang. Age worthy! Very Nice!"
40,"My 6️⃣0️⃣0️⃣th rating, #39/40 in the UGCB Bordeaux 2015 tasting and one of the absolute 💫s of the evening! When walking to the Pessac stand two guests, separately from each other, adviced me to try Chevalier. Absolutely complete and balanced with all assets in the right place. Deeply concentrated full blown fruit aroma’s, velvety, beautiful acids and looooong 🎯."
41,"Tonight we're only drinking one glass :) but what a delicious one. Dark berries, tobacco leaves, flowery notes, super fine tannins and beautifully integrated oak. Decanted four hours and getting better and better. Will easily go another 15-20 years. Cheers!"

47,"Magic wine At first, when smelling it one might think of an old champagne where the bubbles are extremely fine. Complex wine."
48,"Really smooth, with oak and vanilla, tasted after the 16 interestingly which showed the difference in tannin and acid levels. Tasted at the chateau"
49,Restrained aromas of cherry and raspberry still dominates in this magnum. Fine grained tannins. Lacks only intensity on the nose.
50,"Nose of caramel, dried fruit and spices, quite complex. Tannin is medium, fruit is balanced with acid and tannin. Very elegant with coffee flavor  "
51,Perhaps some bottle to bottle variation here. A bit more minerals compared to the ones we tasted on the past. Still very lovely
52,4.4/5.0 wonderful ripe and succulent red fruit. Cinnamon and light oak. This 2012 is starting to come into its own - could hold even longer.
53,"Duft av lær, like well worn Docksides shoes 👞 Still fresh and alive 24 years old Bordeaux. Fantastisk til reinsdyr. Språkforvirring 😂🍷"

68,"Purchased in France during trip to Bordeaux. Really enjoyable. Decant for a while, opens nicely. Smooth, right amount of tannin with structure."

70,"Medium gold in colour, pronounced intensity, dry, medium + acid, full body, long finish. apricot, peach, honey, nutty, caramel. Outstanding wine"
71,87 is always not a good year for Bordeaux red. But this was way better than expected. Would not have expected it to be of this vintage.
72,"Barnyard. ‘Interesting’ on the nose, thick in the mouth, stunning flavours of oak and tobacco softened by blackcurrants. Absolute classic."
73,Surprisingly still alive and kicking. Probably one of the better Bordeaux Blancs produced ( next to HB Blanc of course). 92 points.
74,"Open up a bit since barrel tasting, still has a long way to go. Can’t tell how exactly it will develop but definitely getting better and better."
75,"Light to mid gold. Popcorn aroma. ..buttery, ripe stone fruit, toasty , a hint of straw and full body. Mid to long after taste...very impressive"
76,One of the best value Bordeaux in my opinion. Exceptional wine all around - rich smooth creamy mouthfeel and wonderful finish :-)
77,"What an excellent red this was! Super balanced, soft with nice touch of oak and blueberry on the palate. Nose has some tobacco and vanilla"

79,"Fantastic nose of tobacco, dark chocolate, ripe plums and cooked dark fruits with sweet spices. Palate good acidity with ripe smooth tannins."
80,"Really soft and well balanced. Showing plum, blueberry, cedar, leather, black cherry, baking spices, blackberry and light earthy finish."
81,Very smooth a wonderful aroma and taste of dark fruit. Soft tannins and s long lasting sensation on the palette highly recommend it
82,"Liquorice and soft oak and vanilla. Most of the fruit has gone. But wonderfully soft in the mouth. Good finish, but I expected more."
83,"Brilliant of the Graves! Dark ruby Nose - sweet berries, plum jam Smooth, good volume, tannic, tart Cherry, plum jam, berries"

89,"4.3 Drinks like a proper GCC. Concentrated blueberry and cassis fruit, lined by cherries. Nice bit of barnyard on the nose as well. Lovely chewy tannins."
90,"A classic domain with traditional blend of 66% Cabernet Sauvignon, 28% Merlot and 6% Petit Verdot. Chocolate, blackberries, oak, leather & nutty licorice. 4.25+"
91,4.5 French Bordeaux from left bank. Not much fruit on the nose and is dry. But the impressive part is how it grew after 1.5 hours breathing. It transformed the wine.
92,Love this wine ! Floral notes on the nose with elegant balance and such finesse that it is like a flower blooming. Great palate with sweetness and a nice finish !
93,"Hayday is not yet come for this wine but really good. Slightly tannin, requires time to breathe, at least one hour. I am used to drink too fast. Bad habit!"
94,"Surprising alive. The DBM format must have helped. Pronounced nose of tobacco, coffee, leather with red berries. Complex, well balanced with med+ length."
95,"4.2 - Taken at the Painswick Hotel on corkage from Huntsworth wines. 88. Fairly structured, complex, quite tannic. Cassis & blackcurrant & leather & not much else."
96,Is a punch to the nose but not the mouth. It needs something marinated with a lot of herbs or spice to withstand the full frontal assault to your odiferous sense.
97,Medium bodied and grew and grew in the glass. Berry ruby fruits and a good thinking wine. Will be better decanted and 10 years from now.
98,"A silky Pessac Leognan with notes of scorched earth, tobacco leaf and black n red currants. Complex aromatics are followed by a savory, expansively flavored wine."
99,"Golden yellow, strong minerality and terroir. More open now then in dec 2018. Some butter, vanilla and biscuit. Banana and peach. Really nice and special."
100,Agree with Dan West on this one. Super soft and well balanced. Little smoke and leather combined with some dried red fruit.and black cherry.
101,This wine is beginning to show it’s true form. It has plum and blackberry with minerality to show the layers. Sits around 4.3 but in right setting will do even better
102,Dark and opulent ruby in color with floral and lead on the nose. A velvet and chocolate palate with a pleasant finish. A great effort that is ready to drink now.
103,"@ Cru tasting. Always one of the best wines of the tasting and usually the best QPR. Lots of flavour, vanille, rich fruit and so well rounded. Lovely wine."
104,"Smells like heaven. Tastes like earth. Did well to let it breathe awhile to get the best of it. Not cheap, but spoiling ourselves in the festive season."
105,"Fantastic rich nose of cassis and oak. Palate is long and dark, lots more blackcurrant and cedar and a touch of vanilla. Lovely long finish - really drinking well now"
106,Delicious Bordeaux that is drinking beautifully now. Black fruits with notes of leather and smoke. Time has allowed for well integrated tannins. Fantastic.
107,Commanderie de Bordeaux Gala in Royal Savoy - Lausannes - November 2018. This had a nose to die for. What a wine. Had with cheese course. It performed really well.
108,"92-94pts. Still youthful. Lemon-tart , green apple and a bit of exotic flavour. Its a fine version with a ripe touch. Brilliant balance. Still improving."
109,"Deep, balanced, butter, brioche, some ham, wet stone (if you ever licked one :) ). Works wonderfully with meat! Quite a treat although of course pricey!"
110,"Tasted after the 1985. Same earthy, tobacco and dark berries emerge but this wine was just slightly over its prime. Great bottle nonetheless but drink now."
111,Very good wine in a great vintage. Rich and full of flavours. Very pleasant to drink already and a good wine that is for sure developing further in the future.
112,"Whew! Lovely lift on this wine. Cedar cigar box, black fruits, and awesome balance. You really can feel the acid keeping this bright. Very drinkable even young."
113,"93 p. Slightly maturing hue. Some smoky notes, red berries, peppers and wood. Very fine balance, elegant, with good fruit and a long finish with medium grained tannins"
114,"Black olives, leather, eau de cologne, red beet, grilled aubergine, turkish delight, plums, Add the equilibrium of a top class great wine. Delicious !"
115,Bought 20ish years ago to celebrate the birth of my baby sister! Worth the wait. Imagine a leather bag filled with red fruits. Enjoying every sip! Wow!
116,"Nosing: full intense fruity smell. Unbelievable Taste: oak, herb, cigar, leather, tobacco. Wonderful Full bodied. Amazing wine! 09 is way better than 10."
117,"Deep ruby. Aromas of dark plum, blackcurrant, Vanilla, roses, cedar. On the palate bone dry, high ac, med/ high tann. Dark plum, vanilla, hint of mint. Long. Med./ full body."
118,Pretty good wine. Typical Graves style. Velvet on your tongue. This wine needs 2 hours to breathe. Added to my shopping list.
119,"4,25 God bless a vintage like 2000. This is full of fruit but evolved into an elegant mix of dark cherries, wet floor, leather and green leaves. Profound and balanced. Not bomb"
120,"This Pessac-Leognan shows the typical flavour profile of blackberry, dark cherry, leather and oak, with hints of green pepper and pencil shavings. There is a beam of minerality on the long finish."
121,94 pts. Out of a double Magnum. Pale Ruby red. Developed nose with a bunch of fruits and fresh mushroom and a bit of whit truffle. Full body with soft tannins and medium to long finish.
122,Rounded and integrated. Restrained power goes on forever. Beautiful length and plummy notes. Drinking well in 2013. Can only get better. Decant and give lots of air. Tasted Nov 2013
123,"Elegant. Oak, smoky, pears, long finish. Good value. Didn't perform as well as the 1995 or 2009, sulking a one would have said, can try to have it again one for each of the next three years."
124,"Love this Chevalier 2000 a lot. Floral, red fruits, forest floor, earthy, wet stone, chocolate. Silky tannin and well balance. I start falling in love with Pessac Leognan!"
125,"Great wine. Red berries, nice oak, leather and maybe some vanilla. Smooth taste. Believe I can taste that famous mineral note too. Fine tannins. Looking forward to drinking this wine again."
126,"Explosive of flavor on the nose including blackberry, tobacco, leather with hints of floral. On the palate, well balanced structure with fine tannins. Brilliantly long complex finish."
127,Ripe fruits overwhelmed the nose. However the palette didn't match the nose in the maturity of fruits. Looks like it needs another 10 yes of btl age to bring out the full potential.
128,As expected. Super smooth and perfectly balanced. Needs an hour at least to open up. Beautifully full bodied and rich with notes of cassis and plum. Paired well with a ribeye.
129,"Dark fruit, tobacco, vanilla in a glass. Double decantered and left for an hour, sensational but my guess is will be even better in another 10 years.....now where did I buy this, I need to buy more"
130,"Eye: noble ruby with cognac rim snd long legs. Nose: countryard, red fruits, shade of cedar. Palate; balanced, but with high citricity, full to medium body, good long aftertaste."
131,"Vibrant flavors of crystallized lemon peel and pungent white flowers, currants, honeyed citrus, fig, and crushed rocks. Finishes very fresh and long, with impressive energy."
132,"No tasting notes, just stars Recently I tried 1999 and could say this is 1998 also in a perfect conditions . Resume: excellent, on its peak now and 5 years more I think. Pro Wein 2018"
133,"EP sample. Bright garnet. Fragrant and floral nose of violets and purple fruits. Quite dense palate, intense but not too weighty, purple fruits-dominant, balanced, fine, very very long"
134,Tobacco minerality wet earth Black fruits Iron shavings sublime balance integrated tannins and long aftertaste. Very good to drink and likely to improve a tad bit more with 5-8 years of cellaring
135,"A thrilling Chevalier faring much better than its status. Pure and elegant with nice complexity. Fully mature with earthy notes but still plenty of fruits. Very long, with a nice balance."
136,"Amazingly fresh taking into consideration of 1992 vintage. Good structure and still refined acidity, I love those Bordeaux wines that really call to be a wine with life."
137,"Pale straw colour; vanilla, grapefruit, lemon, clean; almonds lemon and lime, honey, smoky, salty, 13%, mineral beauty, great with our Easter crab!"
138,"Drinking beautifully. Oaky nose with some lead/pencil shavings. Palate was an explosion of fruits, mixture of red and dark berries. Medium finish, absolutely at its prime now."
139,"Unbelievable, feels like licking a ripe peach. Acidity handles the heavy oak with no problem and creates a delightfully complex dried fruit aroma with notes of mild fizzy pineapples on the tongue."
140,"very enjoyable, not pronounced aroma, fruit with hint of spice, extremely balanced and flavoured in mouth, fine tannin, little mineral,little spice,major fruity flavour, smooth texture, good length"
141,"👀 light purple color 👃🏻 Cherry and raspberry with some great secondary notes of chocolate and mushroom 👅 Light dry wine with little tannin and medium acidity, short finish and low intensity"
142,"Delicious. Nice aromatics and grippy tannins. Still young and powerful but enjoyable now. Looking forward to try older vintages. Strong alcohol, notes of chocolate and dark fruits. 4.4"
143,"Dark ruby colour. Cedar, forest floor, pencil, black cherry and oak nose, Incredible, mellow, intense and well balanced palate following the nose. Super smooth long lasting tannins on the finish."
144,"Quite complex, potentially another year or two to unwind? Its slightly tart, big jammy fruit and a lengthy finish. Its quite pretty and as always, a great representation of the region."
145,So smooth and butter filed. Has a great tartness that is refreshing and great with lobster or fried seafood. Very complex and a total treat for anyone that can get a hold of this.
146,"Was able to taste at Wine Spectator Grand Tour. Didn’t take many notes, but remember the distinct earthiness on the nose and palette. The tannins were oh-so smooth, and soft yet nice finish."
147,My favourite tour when I visited Bordeaux. I managed to buy a vintage of 1999 when I was there. This wine was bursting with passion after one hour in the decanter every sip felt tantric.
148,"Young but pleasant to enjoy. 30 minutes decanting is required. First acidic and tannic, but later smooth and sweet coming from Merlot. Shy below 4/5."
149,"3.75/5 Usually a big fan of Chevalier, this 2004 was a bit closed and did not open nicely. We had no time to decant or let it breath though. Toasted coffee bean aromas and dark fruits"
150,"Vivino Gathering. #8 Back to the barnyard again! In a strong way. Luckily there are good levels of mushroom, wet earth and spice to make it sophisticated. A small four star experience for me."
151,Quite shy and reserved on the nose to start but really opened up about an hour later. Would have been better if decantered. Comes from a perfect vintage. Chalky and tabaco. Another 5 years at least.
152,"Displays floral, blackberry and mineral aromas, with a hint of fresh tobacco. Full-bodied, with supersilky tannins and a long, caressing finish. Has a fine, polished texture."
153,"Ruby, no signs of brown. In the nose blueberry and red fruits with chocolate and coffee and leather notes. The first time I get the idea what pessac leognan stands for."
154,"Such a beauty! Nose was complex with cooked black fruit aromas, black pepper, eucalyptus and coffee. Full body, high tannins and M+ Acidity. Nice spices, cooked black cherry and a long finish. Outstanding wine!!"
155,"An outstanding Graves, fully mature, with sweet tannins, a long aftertaste and excellent balance. Slightly earthy, with a cassis backbone."
156,"This is the most collected white wine from Bordeaux left bank. 2012 was indeed a very difficult vintage for Bordeaux in general, but in fact a fantastic year for white grapes. 70% Sauvignon Blanc, 30% Semillon, barrel fermented, 30-35% in new oak for 18 months. Appearance: pale lemon Nose: call it a toned down Sauvignon Blanc, pink grapefruit, passionfruit, subtle oak hints, toast, vanilla Palate: wonderful texture, body, longevity from Semillon, stone and tropical fruits Very long finish!"
157,"Clean clear wine with a deep Ruby core, thin rim and medium+ viscosity. Nose of black fruit aged leather and cedarwood. Quite aromatic on the nose. Palate is dry with medium acidity and med/med+ tannins. Excellent length good depth and structure. A little hot on the finish but a great bottle nonetheless."
158,"3 hours in the decanter. Brick red. On the nose, mushroom earthiness, tomato, dust, cedar, mint, maybe rosemary, black pepper. On the palate, currant, tannic pomegranate, leather. This is a really fun wine with lots of interesting notes and complexity. With each taste, you find something different. I enjoy Chevalier even on the young side with its bracing acidity, but it’s equally interesting 21 years old and I can even see holding it for a few years more."
159,"Excellent aged Bordeaux. Nose: vegetative funk, black cherry, leather, tobacco, vanilla. Palate: Black cherry, black currant, subtle red fruit (cranberry crossed with strawberry but gently on acid), earth, cedar. Elegant, smooth, balanced and layered. Beautiful now, with Chateaubriand, bone marrow gravy and truffle chips. Nov 17"
160,"Odd year 1992 bought for 20 euros,a bargain for a great wine in a poor year. Brown color, fruit is escaping and acid is becoming more dominant. Still elegant, with refinement, and a nice bouquet with plum and dates. A pleasure to drink! Very recommendable in 92 if found at a good price. Should not be stored longer, drink in 2016."
161,One of my favorite red from Bordeaux Grave area. When uncorked the room emmidiately fills up with bright fruits and floral aroma. Color is medium dark with crisp mineral as first impression followed by quite solid tannins and fresh cherry notes. Goes really well with dark chocolate bites!
162,"👁 purple/garnet 👃🏿 black and red currant, plum, baking spices, vanilla 👄 medium + alcohol, medium acidity, supple high medium + tannins, full body 📝 a delightful wine and shows the great potential of 2016 Bordeaux."
163,"Vintage 2008, tasted oct 2017, decanted 2 hours. Full, complex nose with a mix of dark and red ripe berries, blackberry, cassis and raspberries come to mind. Also light tobacco, forestfloor and smokiiness. Very profound. Med - full body is balanced with well integrated fine tannins and perfectly tuned acidity. Very well composed and elegant, a real joy. Drinking very well now, and will get better still."
164,"Second time trying yet remarkably impressive like my first try. Strong and overt vegetal character (spring onion) whilst first poured in glass. Need 10 mins in glass for the rich creamy oaks to unveil. Ripe tropical fruits also start to appear: very ripe pineapple and almost smells like a piña colada! On palate rich, Complex. Lovely creamy oak dominating most parts, then later transited to its herbaceous core. Expressive and such a pleasure to drink."
165,"Old chevalier, but just on its peak!😍 elegant and excellent! Medium gold. Nose is pronounced apricot, mango, dried peach and nuts. Palate is medium + acid, medium body, dry, long finish with little minerals. Great balance, round and smooth!"
166,"Wine is clear,brightness is day bright, medium straw color, edge is pale straw color, no gas, no sediment, viscosity is moderate +. Aroma is clean, lemon jest, grapefruit, white peach, vanilla, toast, roasted almond, mineral, acacia butter aroma. Dry, medium + body, medium + acidity, nutty body texture, medium alcohol, medium + finish, complexity is moderate +."
167,"Very good, nice quality Cab and Merlot blend. Dry and intense flavors of blackberries, blueberries, black cherries, black plums, chocolates, cinnamon, cloves, black olives, vanilla, toast, prunes. Pleasantly integrated acids and rounded silky tannins. Full body."
168,"Really lovely creaminess and rounded flavors. No sharp tannins, delicious leather, oak, and an older Cab flavor. Excellent value and after minimal decanting, the wine easily opens up to fuller and creamier flavors. Extra half star."
169,"The wine that turned me onto Pessac whites of which there are so many fabulous examples! This one is still too young but enjoyed in St Emilion on sample. Mid lemon in colour with a bold and pungent nose full of tropical notes including pineapple, passion fruit, as well as creamy citrus lemon curd. A refreshing and bright palate with plenty of juicy fruit but the finish wasn’t quite as long as hoped."
170,"Deep colour and viscous wine which time has served well. The nose is plummy and almost cold cigar like. Forest fruit, low acidity and alcohol level makes this 16 year old Pessac super smooth and silky on the palette. Lovely stuff"
171,"On the nose the wine has a lovely perfume of ripe dark red fruit, spice and toasted oak. The wine is very well balanced, round and elegant. In the mouth the wine has fresh acidity and fine ripe tannins. 94-96"
172,"Interesting nose here, almost ""Rhône-like"" to me, that meaty, smoky bacon and spice thing. On the palate juicy fresh, nice dark dried fruit, very smooth fruit, lots of coffee and quite some vanilla oak. Tasty!"
173,"Ruby, slightly dim. Perfect brick rim. Quite viscous. Swimming pool, herbs, stalks. Quite small nose. Acidic attack grows to big body. Tannic finish. Lingonberry. Very long. Grows with food and airing. Perfect maturity. Very good indeed."
174,"A 2009 Pessac Leognan Gran Cru for a Saturday night dinner. A demanding character with a sophisticated disposition; a true French. The flavorful notes are subtle yet abundant. Black cherry, chocolate, and tobacco feast the palate while the tannins for this eleven year old wine is balanced along with the alcoholic level. The acidity is controlled and certainly French. A great wine!"
175,"Lovely purple color medium intensity; fragrant aroma, sweet fruits with earth, tobacco and mineral; fresh acidity together with silky tannins, very classic Pessac-leognan but round. Long mouth fill finishing"
176,"Superb, rich and elegant. Dry with medium acidity and medium to full body. The tannins are ripe. Notes of Black and red fruits, hints of tobacco and leather (staring to develop), cedar and subtle oak. Long finish with hints of spices. Complex yet structured and subtle, this beauty will continue to blossom and will develop beautifully."
177,"I think this wine is a little pricey, however this is a great wine. Medium. Body, great nose, white peach on the nose and the palate. Not great lasting but it will develop greatly in an hour. If you have the opportunity to try it!"
178,"With 3 of my top 10 wines (to date) coming from this vintage I am hopeful of this chevalier which I’ve had many vintages of but this the oldest. Immediately seals the deal on the first sip much better than the other vintages I’ve had. Medium garnet with tawny edges, dried fruit and forest floor aromas. On palette, dry, medium - acidity, medium body, medium - tannin, dried cherry, cranberry, mushroom, pepper and vegetal notes. Finish is long and satisfying. A triumph and definitely with life ahead! 4.25+"
179,"Bought this bottle at Idealwine auction. We like a lot this domaine, but this one was below our expectations. The color is surprisingly not dense. Strong aroma of bell pepper dominates nose with additional notes of red fruit, particularly cherry and raspberry,chocolate, hint of vanilla, wet stone. On palate (in accordance with the color) medium bodied with hints of tannins, bright acidity and very good balance. Red fruit and fruit punch, cherry, strawberry, raspberry, vanilla, coffee, long aftertaste. 3.8🌟"
180,"A well balanced SB, with ripe and medium intensity of pear, apple, white peach , floral , toasted almond and vanilla. It has good acidity, balanced by the ripe fruits. Finish is medium, or plus, just lacking some weight on the palate."
181,"Beautiful mature bouquet, with all the right elements there, cassis, tobacco and cigarrbox. Very good for the year, red berries, quite soft tannins and lots of power. Aftertaste a little short, but wonderful."
182,"Pulled it out from my cheap rack.... it’s no cheapy and was stupidly misplaced! An expected ‘it will do wine’ turned out to be a wow this is great. So balanced, the fat was nicely broken with smooth berries. A lovely wine"
183,"Dark ruby... expressive notes of black fruits, cedar, chocolate and spices, with some crushed rocks as well... medium bodied, polished tannins... some more weight in the mid palate would make it an impecable wine!!! Very pessac!! Ready to drink!!! Love it!!!"
184,"Deep raspberry, black fruit and cedar on the nose. Still powerful presence on the palate with additional forest floor some iodine. Well balanced intense fruit flavours framed by tightly beaded tannins. Medium alcohol. Definitely muscular. Supple, long finish."
185,"This wine has stood up really well to time. A great wine with blackberries, vanilla and hints of orange peel on the nose. Very smooth palette with nice tannins and a very very long finish! Love this wine!"
186,"excellent wine! I could nurse this the whole day.. color deep ruby. viscosity med nose of juicy dark fruit with blackcurrant, cassis and rhubarb notes and well integrated oak. palate rich with med+ body and rounded med tannins. more dark fruit here with candied herb, eucalyptus, and a hint of mint. light organic forest floor. great balance in the structure with a delicious length petering into long finish."
187,"Structured, balanced, youthful wine. Opened 3hours prior, plums, berries, a beautiful sense of the cask; hints of graphite, fresh greens, tea, cola: elegant yet energetic, fine tannins, lively acidity, would love to taste again in five to eight years. Very tender lamb loins, raised and butchered in county. Lovely dinner with my wife."
188,"Blackberry, violet, fern, undergrowth, mushroom, truffle, leather, and nevertheless a very pleasant freshness, this is clean cut, very silky but precise, drinking now and fore some years. Well made and elegant. Bordeaux as it should be."
189,"Impressive dark red colour. Black current, blackberry. Still very fresh, decent acidity and tannin tough it is well balanced. A touch of cedar in the end. Could easily wait for another decade. Strong potential"
190,Great wine! The outstanding 2000 vintage is starting to show well now. With spicy hints and rich tobacco aromas this liquorice laced red has a medium bodied elegance coupled with a subtle tone of oak. On the palate is well balanced and well rounded with smooth velvety tannins and a long elegant finish.
191,"Garnet in the bottle and opaque. Nose is deep leather, tobacco, black olive. Medium plus body and medium plus acidity. Palate is deep and dry. Loamy earth, leather, tar. Incredible length. Eating earth and loving it. Speechless.4.5"
192,"Great vintage for the chevalier. It’s still somewhat closed and the Bouquet shows (only) medium+ with blackberries, cedar, roasted coffee bean and wood floor. Palate shows an extreme finesse and is of medium+’density. Great balance and gentle tannins. Very high aromatics (yellow pepper, graphite, wild berries). Medium - long finish. 93-94/100 Fine and elegant wine, which will grow more and more! Drink best 2024-2036."
193,"Imposing structure. 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot. Dark red cherry, plum, smoke, spice and leather. Touch of pepper and herbal acidity. Dark and dense structure. A serious wine with a great future. Hold for at least 3-6 years."
194,"Ripe plum, cherry and oak on the nose. Some earthiness noted on the palate in addition to the red fruits. Medium acidity with a medium-long finish. Overall the wine has an air of elegance to it. 17/09/20"
195,"Splendid! This got better and better in the glass as time progressed. Well sketched Cabernet dominant blend: namely black currant, cedar, strawberry on the nose. The palate is smooth and well balanced, earthy, tobacco, and slightly leafy herbal with good fruit tones. Great length too."
196,"Great wine from famous producer 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 5% Petit Verdot, 16-20 month in oak barrels, a very dark ruby color. Aroma of black fruits, black currants, cherries, chokeberries, plums, cedar, sweet herbs, licorice, plum liqueur, dried plums, oak barrel. Wine juicy, with balanced fruity acidity and tannins, good complexity. Finish elegant and long."
197,"From an area that was severely frosted, Chevalier 2017, losing some 30% of their crop, was critically very well reviewed. With 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot, the Grand Vin showed well with a nice balance of new oak and fresh fruit. Young tannins that will round out before bottling, to a good lingering finish."
198,"Dark fruits such as plum, blueberries and liquorice on the nose. Not really acidic at all with soft and elegant tannins along a complex layered of cocoa, bittersweet plums and more liquorice on the palate. The wine itself is very well structured, with initial fruity driven on the nose but it doesn’t get overwhelmed at the palate. It has long finish with a salty aftertaste that keep on lingering underneath your tongue. 4.5/5 🍷"
199,"Tasted alongside the 13 smith Haut lafite from a vinotech machine in Max Bordeaux. This was darker in colour and palate, brooding, powerful. Earthy. Preferred and I am seeking some out at home. Pessac-leognan is my new fave Bordeaux appellation"
200,"What a delicious wine is this white 2004 Domaine de Chevalier. It continues to improve. Some secondary notes now. Hazelnut, hay, mineral, perfect balance. What a wine. I honestly believe this will get even better. I should leave the rest of the case another few years. Thanks Jordi Hompes for enjoying this with me (you think this old, wait for the next one)"
201,"Happy Bordeaux Sunday 🍷 Pessac-Léognan red from my fave producer. CS/M/PV 65/30/5 Deep ruby color. Complex and pronounced nose: cassis, dark berries, slight hint of cedar, earthy, tobacco, leather, vanilla, coffee, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves. Compared to nose, less flavor intensity on the palate, yet complex, rich and deep. Acidity is racy, tannins were grippy first but gets smoother in the glass. Very nice now and will benefit from cellaring. 4.2* Even better with great QPR!"
202,"One of my favorite Pessac and this very hot summer year is no different apart form the fact that you can drink a somewhat ""young"" vintage right now! Very round tannins with sundried red berries, oaky but not overwhelming. Great go to wine."
203,"A very classy nose of plums, cherries, cedar, anise and herbs. Mellow and carressing mouth-feel, still with plenty of fruit presence all along the tasting curve. Layered, graceful and long. Seems fully resolved and ready, at least in my book..."
204,"Decanted for two hours before pairing with grilled lamb chops. Deep ruby colouring with a bold nose of cassis, plum, smoke, leather, and a bit of cedar. Sharp in acidity and full of gripping tannins, the wine presents a full body of ripe dark fruit, mature oak, and smoky, leather, and coffee / dark chocolate flavours. A great wine with an impacting finish of olive, leather, and coffee flavours. Could age for many more years but I got impatient. Paired immaculately with the lamb as well."
205,"Dark ruby red colour, full bodied. On nose, rich fruity with blackcurrant, blackberry, plum, earthy and oaky aromas. On palate, milk chocolate, coffee, vanilla, black fruit, cassis, leather and tobacco taste. Extremely nice wine with a bit spicy during first sip but very smooth texture with low acidity and strong tannins.. long finish wine and it definitely need to decants for long hours to enjoy to its fullness..... I will give 4.7/5.0 wine...."
206,Discuss.hk 2017.11.03 酒聚 First runner up of the night to my very personal Was blind tasted. I guessed it was quite vintaged. Loved the smoothness and the balance. Took home after the gathering for my tasting again tmr!
207,"Outstanding Bordeaux, full-bodied, medium acidity and tannins, elegant, smooth and silky, deep flavour, rich bouquet, hints of black currant, black cherry, liquorice, tobacco, cedar, an absolute delight and pure love from the first sip. I would decant it next time less and in a narrow decanter as decanting in wide one takes the part of the beauty away."
208,"In my top 5, I really enjoy the Pessac reds this vintage. The fresh and wildness to the red fruit is sublime. This Chevalier steps into its own class and really is a delicious wine. Not quite as seamless as the haut bailly, its just downright charming."
209,"Slightly behind the 2009 vintage (not just by year lol), the 2008 is a less powerful but more elegant wine. Aromas of black currant, plum, cassis and tobacco, medium to full body, balanced tannins, fresh acidity with smoky - oaky finish. Still a great wine!"
210,"At the UGCB 2017 tasting in Chicago Jan 22nd. A Grand Cru Classe Graves.   Mix of oak and dark fruit, very nice medium tannins and a medium length dry finish. Vintage 2017. Varietal: 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, 5% Petit Verdot.   Estimate 94-92 points   (How my star rating works for pre tastings, based on middle score... 5 STARS = 100-96 points, 4.5 = 95-93, 4 = 92-90, 3.5 = 89-87, 3 = 86-84, 2.5=83-81, 2=80-78, 1.5=77-75, 1=74-50)"

Full bodied with fine integrated 💪🏿 tannins, M+ acidity, velvety softly cheek coating mouthfeel 👄 high complexity, long dry black and blue fruit and Christmas spice finish. 65%CS/30M/5PV. No decant needed! 😋"
213,Happy ‘Pessac’ Bordeaux Sunday dear friends! Detailed tasting note already exists from me on this gem which comes so great out of the Demi’s right now. The prior note is spot on but has phenomenal Christmas Cake now too. This is really close to a 5 🌟 now already. From Demi ready to drink with a 2h decant. Full bottles leave until 2025ish. Long life ahead. Was awesome with Goose btw 😋 95p+
214,"Nose is still a bit tight, but those tertiary notes are now coming through—wet leaves and tobacco accompanying the unmistakable cassis, bramble, some wild raspberry, dried lavender, sweet spice, musk and smoky, vanillin oak. A complex nose and palate that announces classic Bordeaux, but with a supple texture that suggests modernity and youth. Oak, fruit and refreshing acidity all coalescing into a polished, elegant drop. Finish is spectacularly long, the sandy tannins still bursting with fruit for minutes."
215,"This is a classic , finesse - styled Graves. A very classy nose of dark plum, black cherry, cedar, star anise and raspberry leaf. Mellow and caressing mouth - feel, still with plenty of fruit presence all along the tasting curve. Multi-layered, graceful and finishing with a nice length. Seems fully resolved and ready, at least in my opinion..."
216,"Poise, class and substance, this Graves has got it all; deep burgundy color, nose of mint, hibiscus, incense, smoke, cranberry and raspberry, wouldn’t you know it, still tannic with fine grained structure and balanced acidity, full body with silky mouthfeel, tastes of mineral, saline, salty meat, sage, anise, hibiscus, espresso bean, dried cranberry, and Earl Gray tea, store smooth elegant long finish, aftertaste of prune, raspberry preserve, quince paste and red vine licorice, complex & layered, marvelous."
217,"Youthful purple color. Ripe and fragrant nose of blackberry and violet. Very good freshness. Medium-bodied, opulent and slightly sweet on the palate. Silky tannins. Very good structure and depth. Very good vigor. Harmonious. Succulent and long on the finish."
218,"Despite the difficult vintage, this Chevalier delivers. Nose a bit discrete but showing elegant red fruits with mint and floral notes. First palate mellow, with elegance and a great structure. Great length with finale à bit unruly. A wine to wait, great potential"
219,"Had my last bottle 4 years ago and this baby is traveling steadily along its plateau. Still lovely, fresh aromatics with a touch of cigar box and remains a deep, purple colour. No real sign of age! Black berries and red currant flavours still dominate with a classic Bordeaux graphite edge. Tannins have softened but still firm enough to see this through to 2030. A long, woodspice finish. One of the best 2008 Right Banks out there I think 👍🏼🍷"
220,"Powerful red fruit aromas for the nose, immediately followed by oak intense but not overwhelming. Tannins are quite educated, initially striking but then replaced by a fresh and long acidity. The 2012 vintage could have stayed in the bottle for another 10 years without problems, too bad that it's gone now!"
221,"For once, a wine that justifies its price tag! Chocolate, tobacco, oak, cassis, leather and perhaps a something extra I can’t put my finger on; and that’s just the nose! Beautifully smooth at first with balanced tannins and acidity followed by a long, warming blackberry finish. This is one to buy again."
222,Drank 22 Oct. Preferred this to the Mersault tasted on the same night. Has more character and body and the freshness and acidity makes it so much more lively. Can further evolve with a few years more of cellaring
223,"CHEVALIERS DUO #2/2  1990 Dom. de Chevalier Darker garnet than the '86, with orangey hue on the rim. Strong earthy perfume with dense black fruits, creme de cassis, cedar, stewed plums, dark chocolate. With some airtime, a beasty tertiary note comes out. Sleek velvet covers the palate with luscious berries. Tannins are well integrated yet still eloquent. Fab balances of all the components, rounded mouthfeel with luscious elegance. Aromas get stronger with more airtime adding some Othmanthus. Good fruit, >>>"
224,"Dark ruby color, concentrated blackurrant aromas and flavors, vanilla, toast , spices . Full body , high tanins, high alcohol with a very long finish. Too young to drink ( would need a serious decanting time) , to keep for 10 + years ! This wine has a lot of potential!"
225,"2009 for Bordeaux is definitely one of the best vintages in the past 30 years. Amazingly complex wine with black currant, blackberry, cranberry, cedar, cigar box, leather, forest floor. After one hour in the decanter, it showed a strong note of truffle, which isn’t a common note but is absolutely charming. This bottle can keep at least another decade."
226,"Beautiful bouquet, aromas of dark fruits, earth and tobacco. On the palette, it touchs you with soft tannins taking you on a journey through homey fields and lands. Excellent wine, and excellent value. Would buy again."
227,"Feels still young with strawberries, raspberries & minerals flavours, light and silky tannin, elegant style , a light Bordeaux or a powerful burgundy —somewhere in between ,could drink it with some light bites or more delicate food rather than red meats ,good value for money"
228,"A great deal of concentration in this Graves. Weighty black cherry nose,and a polished and luxe structure that has almost new world depth. Long finish that has fine tannins to balance the mouth -filling extracted dark fruit"
229,"It should be drunken bit earlier than 2020. Having said that, this one was fantastic red. Very smooth but still maintaining its good tannic nature. Gentle and sophisticated Bordeaux this is. Value for money !"
230,"No great wines just great bottles? This is surely one of those. So surprised by how good this is (from 375ml). Deep rich and ripe, intense bouquet, polish oak with a touch of vanilla. The tannins are already soft. It's got good balance and a lovely finish. Bravo!!"
231,"63% Cabernet Sauvignon 30% Merlot n Cabernet Franc. Petit Verdot made up the balance deliver good intensity on the nose with smoky blackcurrant, black cherry stone n soil. Medium to full bodied smooth, supple, bright finish with lovely cedar n silky. Drink now or before 2022. 91/100"
232,"Nose:Dark chocolate with cognac and sweet dark cherry,vanilla,cream cassis, coffee liquor,wood polish. Taste: sour cherry,black currant, mixed forest berries,slight dark chocolate and gooseberry in long lasting finish"
233,"Backlog of notes from the London Lunacy meet up at Cabotte. Wine #8 was a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (66%), Merlot (28%) Petit Verdot (6%) from wine aficionado. Oak aged 18mths. Deep, dark ruby red with nose of smoky cigar box & red fruits. Dry, high acidity with medium body & fine, silky tannins. Silky, smooth & sexy with flavours of cherry, mixed berries & plum on a long satisfying finish. 4.3⭐ Thanks Frédéric👍"
234,"Great Bordeaux with a dark purple color in the aroma and taste, above all dark fruit in the background red fruit palpable dried fig prune raisins notes of oak vanilla chocolate coffee tobacco caramel cedar clove cocoa earthy leather smoke graphite mushrooms forest floor tar pepper licorice cinnamon mint savory nutty almond. Bordeaux is perfectly balanced with high acidity, velvety tannins, a sensational solo wine. 🍇🍷👍🏻😃👌🏻⭐️"
235,"So after the bad bottle of Brunello Casanova Du Neri, decided to open this very well rounded Pesaac. Beautiful nose of dark fruit, hint of leather and tobacco. Excellent rounded tannins, more dark fruit on the taste, blackberries, some blueberries, a medium finish. Good bottle for our wedding anniversary!"
236,"I had the 10 and the 12 and thought they were pretty fair. The 2011 is incredible NOW! I think it has some room for improvement with cellar time but if you need to open a recent Bordeaux tonight, this will make you glad you did."
237,"Cherry, amaretto, soy sauce, red fruits roasted pepperoni, hint of cold smoke. Superb! Med bodied, smooth tannins , pepperoni, than great and almost endless red fruits phase, multilayered, a beauty!"
238,"Excellent wine, classic style, huge potential. Rich, dense, but elegant and even delicate. No modern opulence of Sauvignon, everything is in good balance and oak is well integrated. Delicious and profound wine."
239,"I could smell the aromas from far the moment it was poured onto my glass. Nose of fig, dark chocolate, mocha, hint of plum, savory and gamy. Full bodied, velvety tannin and solid acidity. Absolutely balanced with medium finish. Well matured and I believe it is drinking at its peak now."
240,"Great Bordeaux left Bank 💥🇫🇷 RP - 93 , my - 4.6+ 🍷 Bordeaux blend 🍇 Mix of herbs 🌿 red & black berries Smoke , cedar , plum , raspberry Pure , Balance & structure - 👍 Still quite young , with big potential For me - one of the best French for +- 100 euro 🏆"
241,"A classic Bordeaux at its peak. That typical balance of black fruit ( blackcurrant), red fruit ( cherry). Med body, med tannins, med acidity - this wine is perfectly balanced at 15 years of age! The usual oak, vanilla, leather, tobacco, earthy. Bordeaux is so nice 😊"
242,"Mature Bordeaux..showed grass and wet rocks at first, after some airing in glass showed leather, tobacco leaf, subtle red fruit..smooth from start to finish..again shows what a great wine can be if aged well"
243,"Dark red in color. Tar, leather, tobacco and black plum on the nose. Blackberries, tobacco and leather with smooth tannins on the palate. Paired up with a very tender tenderloin at Palmen at magnificent Grand Hotel."
244,"Outstanding Pessac. Matured and developed. Ripe dark fruits, cassis, candied cherries, mint, vegetables, earthy, cigar box. Lovely texture, balanced acidity, still vibrant tannins, long finish with coffee nuances."
245,"95/100. Precise, clean palate that you can distinguish tastes easily, in a fine balanced way. Mouth watering fruits, velvety tannin and slight leather note adds more pleasure. Hint of sweetness in the end, very long finish. Exceptional wine indeed."
246,"Big surprise!! Performed incredibly well for its age and the vintage we are speaking of, so overall really happy with its showing )bottle was in good condition). Surprisingly good amount of flavors and structure. Nice experience."
247,"Elegance, firmness, balance...all that you can expect from a great Grand Cru Classé de Graves which vines are embraced by cold winds that come from Atlantic Ocean. This wine is also indicated in the book “1001 wines you must try before you die”."
248,"This Passaic Léognan rouge offers a little more fruit than the reds from Margaux I tasted recently. There’s also a nice bouquet of baked blackberries & roasted meat. On the elegant palate, layered flavors of blackcurrant, loganberry, dried fig, gravel & oak show atop a structure of pleasant fine tannins with plenty of acid. Finishes long & quite luscious. Aged in French oak, 70% new. me93, ws92, we95, wa95, d95, jd97, js97 ✅"
249,"The wine of the night. Not to everyone's taste but I love loved this wine. White flesh fruits, rich but with great acidity and long finding. Would be great with lobster bisque. I loved this wine a lot."
250,"Medium ruby red, clear appearance. Pronounced nose of black fruits and red fruit, mocha, dark chocolate, vanilla, oak, chalk. Palate wise is very fine tannins with medium acidity, medium body and long finish."
251,"How delightful! @Tom Murphy you convinced me to rummage in the cellar and find one of the older vintages of this after your recent review of a much younger version. Black plum and leather on the nose. Berries, herbs, in the mouth up front, and a touch of menthol/pepper at the end. Great length, excellent cork. 😋"
252,"Bit of a gasper and WOTN 🥈for me. Full on fruity, Napa style, intense blackcurrant, warm Indian spices, and mulled, but juicy, fruit. 45CS; 45M; 5CF; 5PV and a delicate 12.5 ABVs (where it departs from Napa 😂). So fresh and so young. And yet just been given the key to the door!"
253,"This is now ready to drink. What a difference a year makes (since I tried it last)! Tobacco, chocolate and dark fruit in fine combination. There is a balancing freshness and great structure. Very enjoyable!"
254,blackcurrant vanilla oak leather tobacco blackberry cassis cedar earthy black fruit smoke chocolate minerals black cherry red fruit raspberry coffee graphite blueberry mushroom forest floor toast mint prune dark chocolate butter black plum stone cheese tar red cherry
255,"Surprising still vibrant at this age, even for 1982 vintage. Leather, stem and some green on the nose. Seducing flavors and red fruit. High acidity and has some minimum tannin left which gives it a little bit of strichte. Very fine wine 🍷"
256,"A treat to open with homemade burgers 65% Cab Sauv, 35% Merlot and 5% PV Possibly still a touch young but pretty good for an off year On the nose, black fruits, old leather, tobacco leaf, earthy, pencil shavings, warm spices and a touch medicinal Fruit flavours of blackberry, blackcurrant and dark plum Earthy and smoky Mocha Med+ acidity Warm spices of nutmeg and cinnamon. Sweet vanilla Tannins pretty well integrated with just a touch of grip Long spicy and fruity finish"
257,"Tasted blind. Funky, earthy, exciting nose with bursts of horse stable, sage, coriander, blackberry, and smoked pheasant. Spicy, burning wood embers and red bell pepper. Terroir-driven, Left-Bank Bordeaux, full of earth. Controversial with it’s unabashed herbaceous monologue and funk, but I like it. Drink up."
258,"This is what a young epic Bordeaux should taste like. Left it in my glass for 2 hours before tasting. You can smell it unwinding (like me in the bath). Enjoy. 👀Deep ruby 👃fresh small berries (Very tightly packed). Sweetness of red fruit coming through. Kirsch and other dried black fruit. Juniper, liquorice, pencil and cedar. Smokey. 👅high acidity high and fine tannins (already soft), medium + body and intensity, could be high but the balance is so great its. Wow. Cascades of lovely fruit and spice."
259,"2015 vintage already drinking beautifully at just 4 years. Hot summer that's reflected in perfectly ripe and slightly cooked fruit aromas of blackberry, blackcurrant, cherry and plum. The oak is carefully integrated with aromas of nutmeg and clove. Classic Pessac minerality providing a strong back bone for the wine. Nice structure with fine tannins, pleasant and lasting finish. One of my favorite left bank Bordeaux reds in this price range."
260,"It simply gets closer to the definition of what a superb , rich , full bodied wine is. With a touch of almonds, and high minerals on the nose, complements its flavor by becoming more mellow on the palate with a long lasting berried flavor.. Outstanding with assortments of French cheese."
261,"Fruity & simple Bordeaux. Velvety, round tannins. A little savoury. Ageable to 2038 according to Wine Spectator, which weighed in at 96 pts for this one. Tried at tasting. $170 @ Co-Op. My fav of the night!"
262,Still young for graves classé but well rounded with dark fruit aroma and a subtle taste with hints of vanilla. Very good wine
263,"Another good represent of 2005!! Althought not the front row producer but the wine can deliver the very good woody nose with mild earth and proper red/black fruit.med to full body with oaky tone on palate,very balance of acid and fruit.med finish. Not the particular style but very yummy with great balance."
264,"Edgy powerful fruit, cherry and blackberry, wood, vanilla. Very very pleasant. Well balanced. Balance and power, very full bodied, loads of dark dense fruit, soft tannins, delectable, complex, long savory finish. Wow!!! 95+"
265,"Yum! An understated star of the vintage that competes with its more famous neighbors up the Left Bank. Still a baby but showing its potential and has a certain freshness. Both blackcurrant and red currant, red cherry, potpourri, white pepper."
266,"Deep ruby Pronounced black plum and black Cherry on the nose. Medium acid Dry High tannic More pronounced fruit on the palate after 4 hours in the carafe. Cedar, mint, tobacco and wood/vanilla. Long Complex Outstanding wine. 😄"
267,"66% cab, 28% merlot, and 6% petit verdot blend. Aged 20 months in oak. Soft red fruit nose, candied cherries, silky tannins, slight barnyard and earth funk. Fruit has mellowed and created a wonderful harmony with the earthy tannins. This one is ready to drink now or continue to age."
268,"This, the Lynch-Bages and the Pichon were the highlights of the 2015 Vintage Bordeaux tasting at Sotheby’s in London. Whereas the Lynch-Bages had power and spice, and Pichon had great texture and integration, this had great elegance and persistence. Again, it’s all about imagining where the wine will be in 10 years - I have no idea how the winemakers do it..."
269,"Vintage 2016 opened in 2019. 👀The color is deep purple. 👃The nose is offering cherry, black currant, cassis, blackberry and vanilla. 👅The palate is offering fruit sweetness, black currant, cassis, blackberry, vanilla and oak. Average tannins and average acid. I rate it 8,25 out of 10 points."
270,"Dark Ruby with matured brownish hue. Subtle nose of blueberry, earth, graphite and mineral. On palate it has a rustic feel but showing some nice freshness along with blackcurrant, mineral and graphite. Long finish, fine tannins with a soft grip. Quite a surprise the '83 is still holding well with good structure. Although it has fully matured and ready to enjoy."
271,"Needs air to open up, after about 60-90 minutes patience pays off. Complex nose with smoke, leather, mint, cedar, dust, mushrooms, black currant and licorice. Palate starts off closed with high tannins and acidity. After it breathed for a while, loads and loads of dark fruit with a very long black currant and honey finish. Still at least 5 years of life in this bad boy."
272,"Cherry leather nose. Body had chocolate dipped cherries, lightly drizzled vanilla that slowly ends in blackberry, violet, and iron. Good complexity and flavor. A touch sweet on the first sip but the complexity makes up for it. 66% CS, 28% Merlot, 6% PV 20mo in 50% new oak, 50% used. 4-1"
273,"👁 deep garnet 👃 medium plus intensity, developing aromas. Black cherry, cedar, toast, cloves, black berry, leather, forest floor. 👅 dry, medium plus acid, high tannins, medium alcohol, full body, long finish. In the spot now."
274,"Ok so I had the 2007 of the white Grave a few weeks back and was blown away. Saw this and decided to treat myself and boy oh boy I am not disappointed. Such a classic and I've only just opened it. Can already taste the potential before it opens up. Christmas break, here we come. Yum yum!"
275,"Clear, medium ruby. Clean nose, medium intensity, aromas of red fruits, leather, dust, mint, liquorice, chocolate. Dry. Medium body, medium acidity, medium tannins, flavours of red fruits, leather, dust, mint, liquorice, chocolate. Medium finish. Outstanding."
276,"A very good wine and an excellent way to make life sane during the lockdown. Full- body, deep red color. Nose of boysenberry, vanilla, and brioche. Tastes of plum, red cherry, pepper, tobacco and some cola towards the end. Extremely smooth and well balanced. It was $80 at the store today, which normally I find expensive. But given that the store has to close tomorrow indefinitely, it felt like a good value! 9/10"
277,Deep purplish red and almost opaque . Brilliant aroma on the nose. Solid full body on the palate and very lasting after taste. Probably need longer decant time > 1hour . Need to let it stay slightly longer and roll on the palate to explore the inner structure of this wine.
278,"Bordeaux 1990 at AuZone The only Graves in the field was for me a little more clumsy. Brick colour, animalistic, barn and dark plum on the nose. Sour cherries and rowan berries on the palate and a bit short aftertaste. Robert Parker and the Domain did not exactly like each other back in the days so he scored it only 88p. 4.1⭐️ AuZone votes 1-3 Drink 2020-2023"
279,"Deep violet color with mocha and blackberries and hints of ink ,complex and multilayered aromatic profile, balanced in mouth with youthful yet refined tannins medium acidity and long but not tense aftertaste"
280,#50 Merano Wine Festival 2019 65 cab 25 merlot 10 verdot Very nice intensity with the strawberry jam with a nice vanilla sandalwood light note with a nice blackberry jam coming through with even a ripe apricot Mouth is warm silky smooth with a nice weight with a great strawberry blackberry jam mix with a crisp sandalwood vanilla and a medium acidity and tannin and a tremendous exit and aftertaste 4.25
281,Lovely soft subtle Jose. Soft red strawberries. Velvet in the mouth. Elegant & clean. Exceptionally well balanced. Well recommended
282,"Super interesting side by side tasting of the 07 and the 79. The frame is a copy paste, 79 on tertiary mainly, very Smokey and mineral. 07 expressing the same characteristics with the fruity side on top. Super wines! Rebuy: yes"
283,"A complex wine that has a startling amount of primary fruit in the aroma despite its age. There are aging characters and oak characters that play a supporting role and serve to round out the overall aroma admirably. The tannins are broad and suitably melted from bottle age. The finish is perhaps the best part of this wine. It has length, but it is the understated fruit flavor that really shines."
284,"1982 Domaine de Chevalier #Graves #Bordeaux #Cabernet blend. Amazing at 33 yrs. Notes of lilac, dried cherry, cranberry, red plum, leather, forest floor and a distinctive grass fed beef aspect. Soft, silky and long. #wine #sommelier #sommlife"
285,"98/100 Cooked peach hazelnut almond acacia honey smoked wood dried honeysuckle nectarine under syrup seed oil rubber hint of petrol vanilla cream brulee caramel and custard On palate lime and fresh pineapple High oily viscosity Full body High acidity High alcohol Pronounced intensity Long finish The wine its on peak shows a perfect balance btw the aroma profile. The complexity is on another level along the concentration, the power, the super fresh acidity and texture. This wine is excellent!!!"
286,"4.1 ProWein 2018, Düsseldorf, Germany, 18-20 March. Evening of Crus Classés de Graves. Expressed aroma of dark/red berries, black soil, young not ripe cherry, wood and spices. Dry, high acidity, hardy string and knitting mouth tannins, full body, quite rounded already taste, colors are promising, good structure, sweet green pepper bitterness, stays long at the end. Young but nice for now, what would be with right time❗️🤔😉😊"
287,"Many domaines in Pessac-Léognan make both a red and white wine. I found the whites a bit more interesting. In the nose scents of vanilla, olives, graphite and plums. On the palate spicy, med acidity and tannins. Flavors of cassis, vanilla and a bit of iodine and pepper. Med+ finish. The wine felt too young and hard, this needs 2-3 years to be re-assessed. 15 pts for now @ Perswijn Bordeaux tasting."
288,"Beautiful Pessac Leognan. Deep red color with a long finish. Opened a but gamey with some barnyard. Had the pleasantries of any top grinch wine. Berries, leather, green pepper and some chocolate. We had a long night opening several good bottles but this was a standout."
289,"Quite a delightful wine ‘right off the bat”; richly coloured, full-flavoured dark fruits with a hint of cherry nd black currants lavish the tongue and remain dominant for what can only be said is an amazing length of time"
290,Sample this wine with Serena Hawkins Henry Smith Philip Leah missing Andrew Colin @Andreas Evans Ryan Walkinshaw Hayls
291,Young purple in color with a rim of carmine. Initially minerality in aroma changing to earthy and mushroom and then meaty and savory with airing. Medium to full body. Medium acidity. Nice balanced terroir with mushrooms and ripe black fruits changing to black tea with hints of savory and chocolate and raisins. Integrated but strong tannins. Length 4-5s. Need 1 hr of decanting

320,"Medium to full body, oaky, plum and chocolate smell. Not really long lasting but good price for it. Cheers"

332,"Black currant, cedar and sweet tobacco in the note. Fantastic from the glass and even better with the food."
333,"Aroma had blackcurrant, red cherry, plum, chocolate, coffee, juniper, vanilla, oak. Over the palate came blackcurrant, red cherry,chocolate, earth, black olive, nutmeg, oak."
334,"I read this is a bit passed its prime. I'm not skilled enough to judge that, but I can clearly see the pale, weakened color (brick-ish), and smell/taste very earthy and ""old basement"" notes. Amazing finish, outstanding sweet fruit. Also something magical that comes with age..can't really describe it. Maybe it's purely psychological."
335,"4.5. Wow!! ok, theres an old world moldyness on the nose, signs of a good wine, it dissipates as it breathes. Some sediment so decant. NOSE: Hay fields, rare meat bloodlines, cassis, tart red berries, saw dust, fresh stained woods, alcohol, spice, florals & white pepper. PALATE: That bloody meat shines beautifully followed by the tart fruits, cedar, oak, some spice, leather, tobacco, edible flowers and pencil lead minerals that all comes together in a smooth soft finish that leaves a light chalky palate."
336,"Rather lack the usually performance of a pessac-leognon wine, not very salty but it has the strength and intense of red and blanc fruits, not much tertiary flavors have developed. A very balanced wine. Can be well stored for 5-10 years more if you want to have them in another stage."

338,"17.5+/20. Compex and elegant. Both, in the nose and on the palate."

341,"Oaky, flashy with a fantastic potential!"
342,Blackberry is strong..
343,Deep ruby in colour. Fresh juicy black currant and plum on the palate with a very light tinge or oak tobacco on the tail. Wow... Délicieux !
344,I was not a fan of this wine until now. Good on the nose and has a smooth finish. Very oaky and vanilla. I would definitely get more of this.

351,"Little ink, little funk on the nose. Fantastic earth and ink on pallet"

363,"2011 is 65% Cab, 30% Merlot, 5% Petit Verdot & 13.5% vol. Smooth, polished. Surprisingly foward"
364,blackcurrant plum oak leather vanilla cherry pepper
365,"Varietal definition of Merlot (black fruit, spicy notes, herbaceous) concentration and intensity but very soft tannins. Finish is surprisingly long"
366,"It is full of floral aromas and fruits, and the scent of barrels is fragrant. The tannins are also elegant and well-balanced."
