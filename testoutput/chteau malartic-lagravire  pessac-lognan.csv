7,"Red and dark fruits, earthy, oaky, leather. Your typical Bordeaux style. On the palate, a bit too acidic for my liking, which was more offensive than mouth watering. Price tag is steep for the quality in this bottle."

17,"Your classic Bordeaux wine. The bouquet is a cellar nose. Deep colors, dark fruit characteristics. Perfect acidity. What more can you say. A wonderful second growth"
18,Blueberry jam nose which also translates in the same body. Medium heavy body with liquid medium tannins. Particularly elastic for the Medic blend and really elastic on the tannins.
19,"Opens with intense nose of black currants, cedar wood and green tones. Develops elegantly into tobacco, graphite, dark ripe cherries. Assertive tannins and enticing acidity. Full bodied, complex, layered and mature. A joy."
20,"Ch√¢teau Malartic-Lagravi√®re is one of the only six classified growths both for its red and white in Bordeaux. A blend of 53% Cab Sauv, 35% Merlot, 7% Petit Verdot & 5% Cab Franc, aged 18 months in French oak, 80% new. Rich and dark with berry aromas, complex and enticing. On the palate perfectly ripe blackberry and cherry with earthy dried herbs, some cacao and toasty spice. Fine dusty tannins, well balanced with acidity building to a great finish. Very special."

In mouth it is perfectly balanced, the acidity is in a perfect proportion with softness, silky tannins with an elegant texture, smokey notes, round with a long and fruity persistency. Perfect for ageing."

24,"Intense enough yet very well balanced, beautiful nose, rounded palate with very pleasant tanin and long lasting aftertaste. I did enjoy it very much."
25,Powerful and fine nose with red fruits (strawberry) and plumb aspects. Touch of r√©glisse with strong and already smooth tannins. Awesome!
26,Found this to be one of the best Bordeaux‚Äôs I‚Äôve ever had. Was a real big one- just like I like my wine. 2nd bottle of NYE 2018
27,A refreshing wine of Semillon blend mainly composed of Sauvignon Blanc. It has a classical taste in a pleasant harmony of herbal and barrel scents.
28,"Well balanced, strong tanins and at the same time the wine was not heavy. Oak/vanilla with dark berries/cherry. A very nice typical Bordeaux."
29,"Good strong nose with cedar, leather, mushroom, black cherry, black pepper and smoke. Full bodied with high acidity and a good finish."
30,"Had this bottle second time within a few weeks and the distinctive flavors of cherries and oak are the first impression, followed by a long finish."
31,"Very good! I think that the wine has passed its best point in terms of ageing. Taste of cedar, cherries and oak. Smooth and full bodied."
32,Vintage contrast wasn't bad In Korea the price ratio was disappointing cassis blackberry leather oak tobacco cedar smoke earthy
33,"Audience Grand Cru Classe 2018, Prague Castle, 27th May, 2021 Great wines overall, super fruity and still pretty young vintage 2018!"
34,"Rather a fruity Bordeeaux - very nice now already. Integrated tannins, a bit of bramble, a bit of classy Bordeaux, but rather modern wine. Nice"
35,"Young, full on grace structure. Tannic with cassis and semi leathery nose. Can go on for a long time! Elements of graphite and lead."
36,"This is a lovely wine - so much better than the 2005 I recently had. Lots of fruits, blackberries, hints of smoke, redcurrant. Big big fan! 95"

41,"Christmas wine session officially open!! Superb walnut nose, smelt and bloody tanins,not very complex mouth but decent length, perfect time to open it!"
42,This has to be one of the best Bordeaux wines I have ever drunk I have paid far more and not experienced the wow factor Montrose is still my favourite
43,"This is a different planet altogether. A rich elaborate taste, a superb structure and maturity. 19 years old and at its peak. Magnificent experience."
44,92 Deep purple. Not very open but delicate fruit and blackberry blue berry black currant with elegant wood flavors. Full body aristocratic tannins and long finish.
45,Dark red. Herbs and berries and a hint of tobacco in the nose. Full body and rich fruits with strong tannins. But it needs to breathe at least for one or two hours.
46,"Crisp nose of cut grass and melon. Smooth, buttery and delicious taste of apricots, peaches and pears. Long sublime finish. Am ordering a case, for sure."
47,"Very ripe juicy blackberry, cherry on the nose and palate. Medium soft tannins, low acidity, very long presence of jammy berries. Lots of fruit on this. Very good."
48,4.5 great one. Not on expert but loved it. Dry finish. Lots of berries. Oaky nose. My cup of tea. Medium and great balance. Highly recommended.
49,4.2 stars. Tasted this again and wow! Great balance. Light on entry but then packs a beautifully medium-bodied and structured melange of black and red currant fruits.
50,Really like this now. Is only going to get better with age. It‚Äôs more sav Blanc tasting than some white Bordeaux. I‚Äôm guessing more sav Blanc than semillon.
51,"Deep dark red. Delicious aroma, a little sweetness, ripe fruit, forest floor and spicy notes. Velvet soft on the palate, dark berries, peppers with a long finish.."
52,"Lots of sediment. Fruity aroma with hints of banana. Complex flavor and aroma. Smooth and sweet. Tastes better than it smells. Long, delicious finish. Very good, but expensive."
53,"What a nice surprise! It was way above expectation. Dark ruby color. Seductive aroma of cedar, blackcurrant, smoke leather. Full bodied. SILKY tannin. Performed way beyond its price tag."

56,In the glass rove.. clear yellow On the nose flowers buttery tropical Peaches Onthe palate buttery fullbodied balanced acidity Long aftertaste Peaches Cellaring up to 8 years Wonderful wine !
57,"Given how difficult 2013 was, this wine is a superb feat. Great nose of spicy berries with vanilla oak notes. Not very concentrated but ripe and fresh palate with good persistence"
58,"Pretty nose of floral and nectar. Medium heavy body with silky smooth tannin. A very fruity palate full sweetness. As I usually have St. Emilion, this Graves is distinctively different in style."
59,Wonderful nose full of fruit and earth and oak. Extremely balanced mouth with rounded tannins and a nice balance of fruit and earth. One of the first Bordeaux of wines I have really loved
60,"Strong, peppery taste. Delicious, better structure and complex. Excellent wine. Had this in dec 2014. A few more years will harness the taste as the alcohol dilutes further."
61,oak leather blackberry tobacco cassis blackcurrant smoke plum vanilla cherry cedar earthy chocolate black fruit dark fruit blueberry black cherry red fruit minerals graphite

63,"Finally a Bordeaux wine with style, the fame worthy. Varied flavours of fruit, herbs, ink, cacao, tobacco. Complex wine in perfect balance, nice and tasty. Cleverly made. Great wine."
64,"Decanter well, wait 20-30 minutes to breathe and you can enjoy the spirit of the Pessag-Leognan as long as you want... for an affordable price. Suitable for fried chicken or steak."
65,"Wet leaves, tobacco, plum, prunes, med + acidity, delicious with cheweable tannins. @coppermansion #03dec2018 #briefnotes #bacchus #thegrandtourofbordeaux #2014 #horizontal #tasting"
66,"Pleasant Pessac, but not standing out. Intense nose of fresh cherry, plum and a whiff of chocolate. On the palate nice plums, bitter cherry, coffee, chocolate and an earth finish."
67,"Golden straw color. Odd nose with floral notes and wet stone. Smooth, yet acidic mouthfeel. Hints of lemon zest, brioche, and Bartlett pear. Finishes with a slight minerality."
68,"Clear dark ruby in color. Spicy aromas of Black pepper and dark berries. Bold, medium plus dry with a long lasting astringent finish. Going to be amazing in a couple of years (5+)."
69,A wonderful Pessac which is a part of Bordeaux I‚Äôm enjoying more and more. Cassis is the predominant flavour with slightly earthy and mineral taste too. Superb balance. üê∫ score 9/10.
70,"üëÅ Deep red tinge of brown üëÉ blackberry lots of blackberry üëÖ blackberry, a hint of oak, leather and dark fruit A lovely light wine which lingers nicely on the pallette"

73,Bright glossy blood red transparent. Elegant delicate florals on the nose. Elegant silky mouth feel delicate mixed black fruit. Lovely vibrant acidity and freshness. 4.25 Stars
74,"Very nice red brought by friends tonight, which we decanted given short opening time. Dark on the color and relatively bold, it would match meat the best (as fai C reminds us). It started with some degrees of greenish to the palate, that's why I was thinking raspberries at first. But then it was obviously blackberries, surrounded by vanilla almost chocolate, and spicy leather. Medium length to a mid complex finish. Certainly value for money, given young age."
75,"Really nice balance to this Graves grand cru. Smooth, full bodied, ready to drink now but it‚Äôs acidity and light tannins will preserve it for another few years. The initial nose reveals the barrel aging with hints of vanilla and develop into dark fruit, plum and a little venison. Enjoy!"
76,"A young and elegant wine. Red color, not deep, glossy and beautiful. Very pleasant aroma, complex, floral, black fruit, a little oak, a little spicy. Medium+ body, refreshing acidity (M +), light tannins (M-), long finish. A charming, young, dynamic wine, its future ahead of it. I loved it. Cheers ! üåøü•Ç"
77,"Fresh bouquet of earth, dark fruit and wood. Medium bodied. Smooth and easy palate. Notes of oak, leather and smoke with aromas of red fruit. Nice, integrated acidity. Well balanced elements. Soft finish with chewy tannins."
78,"Purple color, perfumed aromas: cigar box upfront followed by plum, blackberry, fig, strawberry, white pepper. Rounded full bodied wine, already well balanced with supple tannins, very moderate acidity and bold ripe black fruits."
79,"Very complex and tasteful wine. Dry. Delicate, but not very strong nose. But the taste! A lot of it! Rather long aftertaste. Oak, spicy, black berries. Priceworthy...? Maybe not, but highly recommended!"
80,"From de Malartic (1803) through Mme Ricard-Ridoret-Marly to Laurent Perrier (1990) to Bonnie family since 1997; Michel Rolland-Thanos Fakorellis consultants. Gravity filled tanks. 45M 45CB 8CF 2PV. Medium deep red color. Soft, elegant wine, rich and intense, with depth and complexity. Licorice, leather, black üçí liqueur, and graphite. Silky tannins. A thoroughly enjoyable, easily drinkable wine, with many good vintages. Bordeaux Left Bank Blind Tasting 2:6. Recognized Graves, with some help!"
81,Nose has stewed tomato and rhubarb with a light whiff of sweet vanilla. Palate is very silky smooth and with super ripe tomato and red currant. This has plenty of life in it still and will easily go on for another 10yrs. 93/94
82,"Not so elegant nose, a bit unfresh, not the blackcurrant and cedar wood type; improved with air. But in the mouth this one ‚Äúexploded‚Äù. Very dense, very concentrated, lots of extract. Complexity, long and integrated tannins, great length."
83,"This aged journeyman has given us a lot of fun. Sweet, ripe fruit notes on the nose. In the mouth a little more modest, no comparison to the 90s, but still pleasant to drink. A very good pairing with our lamb salmon with fresh beans and tomatoes."
84,The soil: well-drained gravels and clay gravels on shelly limestone and clay subsoil. The grapes: M CS CF PV The color: Dark blend of red pink n purple shade. The taste: Strawberry raspberry powerful n long fruity spicy finish. Quite outstanding!
85,"4.25 stars. Very elegant, well balanced wine. Very vibrant, with good acidity. Seems to have a mineralogy to it as well as. normal Bordeaux descriptors. I think it could have used another 2-4 years, but was still quite delicious."
86,"Black pepper nose with subtle fruit aromas after that. Pepper and spice throughout. Medium plus to full body with big, grippy tannins. The finish is long and very dry. Packed with nice aromas and big flavors. Paired well with hard cheeses. I‚Äôd go 4.1 or 4.2 on this one. Very good! Tried at a big Bordeaux tasting I attended. Cheers! ü•Ç üç∑"
87,"Considering the 2013 vintage is the lowest rated of the last 15 years this is still impressively delicious. The aromas of blackberry, oak and forest floor are richly layered and the flavours don't disappoint. I would advise waiting another year at least and open/decant 3 hours in advance if you can't wait. Beautifully balanced acidity with teeth gripping tannins, this wine will get better and better for decades to come."
88,"Delightful and robust, a wonderful Bordeaux. Cracked this open on my birthday, and right out of the bottle the nose was floral with a hint of black currant, and it was beautifully balanced on my palate and the finish was excellent too. Will be decanting this for 2 hours before I provide more notes üá´üá∑ Cheers!"
89,"This equal blend of CS and merlot with some CF and PV (45/45/8/2) had a complex nose of blueberries, cassis, flowers, clay and oak. Medium+ bodied, dry, velvety, perfectly balance, it had primarily flavors of bell peppers with a long finish of black cherries and peppery notes. Succulent."

Lots of black fruits come straight to the nose followed by a subtle and elegant complexity with hints of licorice, vanilla and graphite. Dry, high but well balanced acidity, round tannins and medium bodied make it very easy to drink. Pleasant fruity finish. I paired it with tapas"
94,"Big bold fruit. Too young. Blackberries, Bing Cherries, tobacco, earthiness and bold fruit. This wine will age well and it should. Shame on me for drinking this now. I should have shelved it. Good news! There‚Äôs more bottles. Bad news! It‚Äôs only 7pm."
95,"What a wonderful wine here, with plenty of energy and loads of fresh and ripe , sweet , earthy and spicy dark raspberries and sensations of woodsmoke, cigar wrapper,dried thyme,wet earth, used leather and cedar. Elegant, refined and polished with resolved tannin ,a notable long lasting length and a fabulous mentholated kick!!"

On the palate, dry, high acid, medium + body, high alcohol, high tannin. Medium + intense flavors of green, herbaceous notes. Medium + finish. Quality of the wine is very good. Can drink now, but has potential for further ageing."
98,"It has been about two years since I last had this vintage from this great producer about two years ago and time has been nothing but kind to it. Garnet and opaque. Nose is a duel of cigar box, leather, cassis and dark flowers. Medium plus body with medium plus acidity. Palate is on the dry side, lots of leather, tobacco, mushroom with some black olive and black licorice at the edge. Not the greatest vintage but a great prodcuer always finds a way. Super now and will improve for 2-3 years. Splendid. 4.4"
99,"Slight brick red rim, but still fairly young in appearance. Nose is of mint, cassis, black currant leaf and graphite. Palate is indestructible... belting acid, juicy tannins and abundant fruit. Black currant, black berries... predominant, but also some tertiary notes. Length is incredible. Great example of classy pessac-leognan, which should age at least another 15 years!"
100,"Tr√®s bon Pessac. Robe rouge, fruits m√ªres, cassis et framboise, cerise. Vanille, √©pices, anis. Excellent Pessac. Red dress, fruits blackberry, black currant, cherry and raspberry. Vanilla, spices, licorice. Bu/drink at le Tonnelier Bulle Switzerland"
101,"Cleaning the Bordeaux corner of my Wine cabinet. The blend is Cabernet, Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Merlot. Deep red color. On the nose ripe red fruits as blackberry and dark plum. On the palate: Almost full-bodied, soft and round. It melts on your tongue. A marvelous integration of tastes from the dark fruit, tannins, oak and vanilla. I have not recorded the price. But you can buy the 2013 vintage for 450 N.kr. at the state retail monopoly. An exceptional wine. 4.3 ‚≠êÔ∏è Cheers my friends"
102,"Dinner with Nilton M1ll1umm, Daisy Coacci and my wife @Flemmings yesterday. Mouthwatering! Deep ruby color, red fruits and toast on mouth, velvety, full bodied, high acidity, mineral finish. 45% Merlot, 45 CS, 8 CF and 2 PV. 16-20 months in oak barrels. Thanks Nilton! Rate 4.4"
103,"Remarkable noseüëÉ big aromas. Bold, fruity but too young. Should have gotten more air than one hour. Probably more like 10-15years in the cellar... Notes of blackberry, plum, vanilla, tobacco, and wood. A really nice bottle from a great chateau, with a lot more potential. 4,4‚≠ê"
104,"Smooth as a baby's bum! It took a while to get going but once opened it was a really so smooth but while also griping you. The jam aspects from the Merlot and the vegetal Cab Sav really went well together and its clear this is made by real professionals as 2014 is supposedly an ""off year""."
105,"Tobacco, oak, slight licorice and dark fruits on the nose. Perfectly integrated tannins, dark berries and a slight touch of vanilla on the palette"
106,"Just had this wine tonight at a steakhouse and really feel this Bordeaux is hitting its prime drinking window. From the moment the sommelier pulled the cork, the fruit, earth, tannins and acidity were in complete harmony. Gravel, lead pencil, cedar, black fruits and currants were evident on the nose. The pallet was fresh, silky, and possessed excellent length. No hints of burning alcohol on the finish. A really good wine at a reasonable Bordeaux price. I‚Äôll be shopping for more of the Malartic."
107,"Cigar, mushroom and blackcurrant on the nose. Hints of leather and pencil shaving, along with some tobacco on the palate. Smooth tannins and long finish. This 2006 vintage is drinking very well now! Love this, especially considering the bargain it is."
108,"Complex and matured aroma of ripe cherry, plum, blueberry, cassis, eucalyptus, pencil, tobacco, leather and cigar box. The taste is delicous with good balance. Fruity and spicy tones with softly tannic structure. Nice matured wine, complex. After 3 days is in good condition. Vintage 2006 was classic and warm vintage. 93+/100."
109,"Deep garnet. Blend of 45% cab sauv, 45% Merlot, 8% cab franc and 2% Petit verdot. Medium intensity in the nose. Black cherry, black raspberry, black currant, chocolate, meat forest floor. Dry, medium.acidity, medium tannins, medium alcohol, full bodied, pronounced flavor. Smokey, spicy, black cherry, and meat. Medium finish. Outstanding quality of wine. 18 months in French oak."
110,"Stood up for four days. Thirty minute slow oxidation in light of a completely saturated cork that seeped wine when the twin blade corkscrew was inserted. Incredibly youthful in the glass - much to my surprise given the cork - showing an almost opaque medium purple with a pale ruby outer edge. The nose revealed soy sauce, tobacco leaf, and dried black currant that‚Äôs almost entirely without sugar or any sweetness. The palate mirrors the nose but with the addition of cracked vintage leather and cedar."
111,"We have been cellaring this thinking it was a lower caliber of wine; however, we just did a double-take (gasp) when we realized this is not a regular Tuesday-kinda-wine! Wowza! L bank Bordeaux, tasting fine at 11 years of age. 59% CS, 38% Merlot, 3% PV. Nose and palate both show dark fruit, cassis, chocolate, cherry, beautiful oak and great acidity. A pretty pleasing wine. PS: We need to work on our cellaring system; Nonetheless, a happy surprise. Happy Days, Vivino Folks üç∑ üç∑"
112,What a great sensation to discover this Pesach-L√©ognan. This vintage was known by its hot summer. So one would-be expect low acidity. I was well surprises by the flavours and the taste of this old wine! Great sensation.
113,"Bordeaux 10 year review number 18/50 Rich, very blackberry nose. Cassis, blackberries, black cherries, milk chocolate, malt, tar and oak with great roasted aromas on the creamy palate. Very dense and round, medium to full bodied, fine-grained tannins and well integrated acidic structure. Herbal, very long lasting blackberry finish ending in a delicate bitter note. My rising star on Pessac sky! Absolutely recommendable since 2009. Same level as SHL or Haut Bailly for much less money (67 üí∞ en primeur) Greatüòç"
114,"Deep Bordeaux red with a subtle orange ring. Dry. Medium-bodied. Well integrated tannins. On the nose very light tobacco, black tea, bay leaf, licorice, coconut. The taste is full of berries, blackberry, blackcurrant, red currant, cherry. A very nice strong finish. Enjoyed it on its own."
115,"Complex, elegant, and bold. Earthy, graphite, and a bit of wet leaves, and dried herbs. Chocolate and French oak. Dark fruit, blackberries, black cherry, raspberries. The tannins structure is firm but smooth as it opens (decant it was harsh as hell the first 30-45, and rounds into shape 1+) I should have saved this one for a steak, but this is a really great wine with a long finish. Well balanced and nice acidity. 4.3"
116,"Dark crimson colour. Classic left bank nose with bing cherry, cedar, cassis, leather and pencil. Mellow earthy wonderful palate following the nose. P&P ready with plenty of life left. Very nice indeed."
117,"Dry leather, tea leaves and strawberry essence at first, developing into a darker stew of confit and damp forest. Keeps evolving, but maybe a touch over the hill. Actually 4 stars but the extra half goes to the fact that you can find this landmark 82 at a pretty cheap deal these days."
118,"Very good quality and price. Clear, inky ruby. Clean, highly aromatic with blackberry, plum, gravel, cocoa and leather. Dry, high acidity, high tannins, full body and long finish. Notes of violet. Well balanced, complex and outstanding quality. NYWE."
119,"Wood, dense dark fruit, black currant, almonds, flowers and sweetness almost jammy is soaring from the glass. Very good! Sweet ripe fruit, black currant, almonds. Towards middle very succulent and deep. Wonderfully complex with freshness and vibe. Long very good finish. Lovely balance. Very very good and charming wine. 96+"
120,"Deep and complex, while 2012 wasn't a great vintage in the Pessac-L√®ognan, this is still an exceptional wine. Old world dirt, cassis and cedar on the nose. Opulent and plush in the pallet with layers of blueberry, tart cherry, crushed gravel and leather framed in silky tannins. This is a special wine."
121,"4.2-4.3 This vintage impressed me better than 09! Btw,I forgot taking pic of this wineüòë Deep ruby with purple hue.

122,"4.3 Excellent wine One of the only 6 classified Bordeaux wines for both their red and their white Dense and structured, Bold yet elegant wine Dark purple with thick legs On the nose Cassis, black berries, spice, earthy notes, vanilla and tobacco.

123,"Very deep purple. Elegant and intense nose with blackberry and licorice aromas. Medium-full body. Very good freshness. Lots of depth and concentration. Very fine, ripe tannins. This is velvety, stylish and finely balanced. Long and chocolatey finish."
124,"5/19: another great Malertic Lagraviere! Tasted the 2009 not so long ago. The 09 clearly needs more time, this 2010 even more. 09 more fruit, 10 more freshness, hints of pepper. Not sure which ine is better, 10 seems more steucturd and may become a greater wine in time. Drink young, 09 is easier."
125,"Very good (4.6) and going to be better. Blackberry, black currant, pepper mix, dried cherry, cigar / cedar and a lot more. Round, powerful, storytelling. –í–µ—Å—å–º–∞ —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–æ –∏ –±—É–¥–µ—Ç –ø–æ—á—Ç–∏ –æ—Ç–ª–∏—á–Ω–æ —á–µ—Ä–µ–∑ –ø–∞—Ä—É-—Ç—Ä–æ–π–∫—É –ª–µ—Ç –∏ –¥–æ–ª–≥–æ –ø–æ—Ç–æ–º."
126,"The wine is open and approachable. Medium ruby in color, medium+ intensity, aroma of strawberry, red berries, herbaceous, with pencil lead. Medium bodied with grippy tannin. The finish is medium. The wine can be aged for another 5 years."
127,"This wine is still a few years off showing it‚Äôs true flavours but it is definitely got blackberry undertones with a slight tobacco finish, I think the fruit will soften over time but not sure about that finish. I still have 3 bottles left so let‚Äôs see what s further year will do."
128,"RP95. Medium red with brown rim. Nose of red current, cherry, and black current. Initial attack is very sweet, followed by bitter dark chocolate, chalky grippy texture in the palate, layered with fruits, prune, crushed plum flavors in the finish. A very evolving and interesting wine to have."
129,"Graves are turning out nice wines in 2017, this one is no exception, deep burgundy color, nose smells of cassis, blackberry, plum, hibiscus, earth, clove, cacao, licorice, sandalwood and star anise, medium to full body with balanced acidity and refined tannin, tastes of blackberry, blackcurrant, rhubarb, tobacco, dark chocolate, licorice, cinnamon and mineral, elegant and smooth finish, short term cellaring will be extremely rewarding."
130,"A nice hot spring. Hot and humid August. 2011 is apparently a good vintage. 55% cab sav, 37% merlot, 5% cab franc and 3% petit Verdot. Beautiful aromas of black fruit, clove and plum. On the palate it is very fruit forward, lots of black fruit, lovely acidity and nice fine medium tannins. Long finish. If you like the 2010 vintage or like your cab sav flavours then you might not like this. Tasted it alongside a 2009 pichon baron and this is probably a poor man's 2009 pichon baron"
131,"3.8 The 2017 has a little more Cabernet sauvignon due to the frost that affected the 2017 season. So this medium full bodied Pessac-L√©ognan is made with 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 3% Petit Verdot and 2% Cabernet Franc. In the glass, it had a deep almandine garnet red color and delivered aromas of blackberry, leather and tobacco. The palate had high tannins, medium high acidity with the berry flavors nicely lasting. I tasted it during the Union des Grands Crus de Bordeaux event held in Montr√©al."
132,"2015 vintage Malartic Lagraviere is awesome, rich, voluptuous n dramatic. Ripe black currant, blueberry, violet, tobacco n pencil. Full bodied layered n lovely texture. Supple finish n great length. Good after 20 to 15 years later. Tasted March. 98/100."
133,Beautiful dark and tick colour. Dark red. Nose a bit close but powerful and fresh. Balanced with a bit of tanin remaining in the mouth. Red fruits with a more matured finish. Could probably wait a couple of years in the cellar. Still young!! Amazing 2000 vintage!
134,"On the nose, a dusty cellar or library, alongside cracked leather, like on an ancient Chesterfield sofa. Fruit wise, black cherry first then dense black currant. Great intensity on the nose. More black currant and leather and cedar on the palette, virtually no tannin. Some sweet vanilla and cedar developing on the nose on the last glass. Great experience."
135,"A classic and solid white from Pessac-Leognan. Succulent yellow and stone fruits on the nose and palate, well-balanced with focused minerals, crisp acidity and a buoyant, layered texture from start to finish. Drinkable now but this is age worthy and will develop more complexity and tertiary characteristics over time."
136,"3.9 ProWein 2018, D√ºsseldorf, Germany, 18-20 March. Evening of Crus Class√©s de Graves. Medium strong aroma of curdy red/dark berries, cherry, young wood and spices. Dry, high acidity, tannins are active and enveloping, full body, taste is structured with good balanced already but still lots to come with years, smooth bitterness, long finishing. My closing wine of the eveningüç∑üëç‚ùóÔ∏è‚èπ"
137,"Solid, with dense layers of fig sauce, plum cake and blackberry confiture, laced with graphite and warm tar details. The long finish ripples with spice hints and black fruit, leaving a mouthwatering feel despite the heft."
138,"The 2006 Malartic Lagraviere is delicious , rich, complex and generous. The nose if full of black fruits, cassis, plum, chocolate, cigar box and vanilla, the body is round smooth and full of flavor, tannins are still a bit firm yet with a short decant the wine is ready to sing. The finish is long, elegant and yummy . My score 91, drink to 2026"
139,"A richly modern-classed growth consulted by Michel Rolland 46 hectares are planted w/45% Merlot, 45% Cab Sauv + rest of Cab Franc & Petit Verdot on gravel & clay limestone soils Wines aged in 70% new oaks 13.5%AbV Double decanted 2 hrs ahead; Rh√¥ne tumbler used; deep red hue; deeply ripe cassis w/camphorated spices + mineral flint & fine oak Richly full w/plushy mouthfeel + liquorice mid palate & ripe-sweet tannins finish Very 50/50 B‚Äôdx blend style Youthfully dull for my taste but well-made"
140,"This already shows a great structure, plenty of spices and some smoke. Lovely grippy tannins, good concentration, an impression of hidden layers. Anticipate at least 5 years before ready to drink. 90+/100"
141,"Dinner time with friends in town, something new and probably best on the wine list. A nice wine with a warming bouquet of blackberry and cherry, some leather. On the palate a very interesting wine, black fruit again dominating , tabacco, earthy tones, coffee. Nice round tannins. A wine, with more time and air, probably would show even more of his power. Now looking forward to go home and open another one, which i never had ..."
142,"After the ch√¢teau's second wine 'La R√©serve de Malartic' we proceeded to the 'grand vin', the 2011 Grand Cru Class√© Malartic-Lagravi√®re in red, a blend of 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Franc and 3% Petit Verdot. It's virtually impossible not to like a wine of this caliber, yet there was a touch of overripeness here, with notes of sweet, ripe cassis, blueberry jam, menthol, mocha & campfire smoke. Fortunately it showed vibrant acidity as well, teamed up with grippy tannins to add structure."
143,"Sailing (Rod Stewart) This wine takes its name and sailing boat on the label from the Earl of Malartic, who defending some French island against the English. Luckily for us he later started a winery, producing excellent reds and whites. This superb red first impressed me with a great nose of red fruit, spices and toast before serving cassis, cherries, tobacco, a bit of wood and darker red fruit on the palate. Structured, round, fat and well balanced this 05 has everything to become a 5* wine in a decade."
144,"Left bank Bordeaux. Deep purple with translucent, electric ruby edges. Elegant dark fruit bouquet opens up to floral aromas, wet leather, river stones, smoke and raisins. Round and silky in the mouth, with big blackberry, black cherry, cassis, licorice and violet notes. Nicely dry. After breathing it really shines."
145,"Dry and dusty on the nose and the palate is tart and rounded, which means, leave it for a hour and then it breathes its life Clove, nutmeg mixed with dark berries Good wine, a couple more years it will be great ..."
146,"Outstanding. Deep ruby color and full body. Fleshy and bold. blackberry, cassis, vanilla, licorice, herb. Need more aging."

155,"Still a cracking wine. Oak, elderflower, peach and lemon zest. This will keep for another decade. Perfect summer drinking."
156,"Lovely drop and 2009 vintage is great. Deep garnet Colour clean wine with a slight deposit. Medium alcohol, medium (+) body, dry, medium (+) tannin and medium acidity. The nose has medium intensity with a lot of ceder, tobacco, oak, blackberry, blueberry, plum, fig, all together in a nice blend. The wine needs a little time in the glass to express this but do not decant as it might fade too soon. Medium finish but lovely experience."

282,"Solid Pessac Leognan. Lots of dark fruit, blackcurrant and cassis. Some cranberry into almost fig. Vanilla from oak. Good, but not spectacular for the price point"
283,"Cannot go wrong with this as a good QPR BDX. Great vintage as well. Liquorice, currants, and reasonably good length are the first impressions. Need to seek out more...."
284,"Nice amber color. Peaches and lots of Car urine on the nose. Tropical fruits, very complex and well balanced. A very nice wine but at the price point it is not great."
285,"Past its peak, so no more fruit notes, mostly earthy and graphite. But still rather elegant."
286,"Blackberry, black cherry, blueberry, nuances of lavender and burnt basil, and a smokey savory finish with sticky umami and tannic characteristics. 92 Points."

302,I now know why 2010 was awarded an exceptional year for Left Bank wines. Enjoying with warm pate de foie gras on toast. Yummmm
303,"Tasted in October 2019 - superb wine, nez puissant, vin qui a du corps, tannins pr√©sentent mais agr√©able. Should have bought more. And in May 2020 - a confinement wine if ever there was one - simply delicious!"
304,"Dark red. Dark fruit, leather and oak on the nose. Blackcurrent, blue plums and mocca on the palate. Full body and powerful fruit. Dry tannins but quite well balanced. Complex with a lovely finish"
305,"Gentle and fruity nose. Full body and smooth taste. Dark fruits with settled tannins. Somewhat dry, which is a bit of a surprise after the fruity nose. Very nice wine, good for all round drinking."
306,The nose is butter and wildflowers and the tiniest hint of cinnamon. The taste is a lot like the nose but has this delicious leathery long finish. Can‚Äôt even wait to serve this to my daughter.
307,"Traditional Graves structure with ripe black fruits, bold tannins intense with balanced acidity and warmth. Still developing and yet to show full potential but lovely and supple now."
308,"4-NYE‚Äô19 4.2. Beautiful wine! Elegant and still with potential. Black fruits and coffee, earthy and with a beautiful touch of dark chocolate. Firm tannins and perfect acidity."

312,"Great nose of red berries, spices and a delicate smokiness. The palate is very balanced and smooth with soft tannins and harmonious complex flavors. Ready to drink and can age a few years still."
313,"Dark inky very dark in color. Graphite and blackberry aromas. Tastes are underripe tart blackberries, with tannins and acidity that haven‚Äôt integrated yet. Still young and developing"
314,This is a great wine!
315,"Another very well made Pessac Leognan with bold fruit, black currant, cassis and ripe cherry, well made and on the palate earthy feel with good structure and long finish."
316,"Silky, powerful, classy and deep. So much cassis on the nose with cedar, chocolate and earth, The palate is so wonderfully balanced between rich black fruit and dancing acidity."
317,In line with my expectations. Still need to open it 2-3h in advance to fully enjoy aromas and flavors. Length could be longer but for a 2011 not very surprising. A good bargain at 29‚Ç¨.
318,Fragrant with black fruits and smokiness at the foreground. Full body with balanced smooth tannin and minerality. Hint of leather and pencil shaving flavour lingering. Long.
319,The nose is redolent of tropical fruits and lilly. The palate is rich. Finely balanced intrnse middle palate fruit with a strong backbone of firm oak and cleaned up with excellent acid.
320,"Garnet, legs. Dark fruit (blackberry, black cherry), vanilla, cedar, tobacco, graphite, mild spice. Medium body, mild acid, smooth medium tannins. Smooth, rich, delicious, though a bit simple."
321,"It has a nice deep red. This is smooth, first taste is dark fruit, then vanilla and oak. has a good earthy kind of like mushroom. I have never tasted terroir quite like this. It has some sediment."

323,"Dark blood purple. Sweet berries on the nose. After 2 hrs of breathing, the fragrant is fully flourished. Light tannins but smooth. Sweet with a plumy after taste. It's absolutely delicious."
324,vanilla vanilla blackcurrant oak leather cassis smoke on the nose well balance firm tannins not strong leather tobacco oak vanilla cassis toast on the palate medium+ finish
325,"Loud and dangerous, more ‚ÄòMotley Cru‚Äò than Grand Cru - a Friday night encore üòé"
326,"Initially very closed, but opened up to chocolate and black berries. Savoury edge to the nose but also quite structured. Post 27km celebratory drink at Hussar Mouille Point with M."
327,"Really 4.5 stars but only because I drank it too early so it‚Äôs not the wine‚Äôs fault. Even so, it‚Äôs nearly flawless. Complex, structured tannins, spicy, full-bodied, rhubarb, and blackberry."
328,"Excellent wine. Very smooth and silky, with the taste of cherry, blackberry and caremel plus a lot of hidden favours; a very complex wine with the feel of class."
329,"Surprisingly, this 2009 vintage is approachable at the moment. Mushroom and truffle nose with both red and black cherry characters on the palate."
330,"Lacking concentration, but being tasted after SHL doesn‚Äôt help in that department. Low on primary fruit, bit green and tannic. Dry cigars."
331,Too young of course (in Nov 2020). Strong tannins will make this much better in a few years. There are better for the price ($70).
332,"Oak, tobacco, leather, mushroom contrasted by some blackberry and blackcurrant. A little bitter but smoothens out well with nice finish."
333,"Good but not great. Mid palate flat and lacking acidity. Somewhat elegant, but without a fine texture and mouthfeel. 90/100."
334,"my favorite toast oak aging style. if you compare with chardonnay, clearly this one has floral, wet stone, wet leave, and strong oak"
335,"At maturity. Dark fruit, currants, earthy nose, confirmed in the mouth. An excellent aged Bordeaux, nice value. Lacks some power."
336,Quiet a disappointment after 4 hours of decanting. A relatively expressive nose but a quiet acid palate with very restricted complexity
337,"Lots of black fruits! Leathery, licorice, vanilla and sweet spice. Very smooth. 14.5% alc - very powerful but doesn‚Äôt slap you with that strong alcohol fumes!"
338,Chateau Malartic Lagraviere. Pessac Leognan. 2010 vintage. Color: Medium Ruby Nose: Medium intensity. Developing. oak tobacco graphite dark fruit plum Palate: Dry. Medium tannins and acidity. Medium alcohol. Medium + bodied with medium finish. Flavour intensity is medium. cedar black cherry stone Quality is Very Good Drink now. Potential for aging.
339,"Super-ripe red cherry and plum. Sweet floral and spice notes, along with ripe, silky tannins. A rich, powerful wine with soft contours and striking depth. 52 % Cabernet Sauvignon, 40 % Merlot, 5 % Cabernet Franc and 3 % Petit Verdot."
340,"Nose of minerals and bitter citrus (litter box). Then white flowers. Somewhat reminiscent of a heavy Sancerre. Rather full and rich. Not very acidic but still somewhat sour. Like an imaginary mix between a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc and a Meursault? Certainly well made, but not my kind of white. 91-94p."
341,"I bought for blind tasting. One guessed it a US wine, Bordeaux blend. One guessed a Rh√¥ne. Reasonable answers as it was so fruit driven, blackberry, cassis woven with vanilla, chocolate, licorice... Left half bottle for day 2. Much developed, cassis, plum, smoke, tobacco, leather, clove... Further cellaring is recommended."
342,Smooth and delicious!
343,"4.2. Hits on all the notes. Blackberry, cassis mixed with menthol and mint. Some green bell pepper. Dusty tannins with subtle grip mixed with a perfect amount of acidity. Well balanced wine. Perfect body and weight"
344,"Needs a little time to open but once it‚Äôs there it‚Äôs a very well balanced delicate white Bordeaux Sauvignon Blanc-semillon blend: light, fresh, creamy, subtle fruits and balanced acidity. Doesn‚Äôt hold up too well to richer food pairings though."
345,"9.0 points; after 3 hours decanting this wine changes in a very fine and elegant claret. Medium alcohol, medium soft an fine ripe tanins, medium length and medium boddied. Good balance and some complexity. Very good to outstanding, can still have some years, but decanting is a must! üç∑üç∑üëçüëçüòòüôèü•à"
346,"Dark cherries, blackcurrant, green notes (ripe capsicum), woody, cassis, baking spices, vanilla and hints of bay leaves Medium body, medium-low acidity, fine tannins. Finishing with almond skin and apricot skin. Punchy yet lightweight. Decant for about 45 mins Pairs beautifully with char-grilled satay, including the peanut sauce and also quite decently with BBQ chicken wings"
347,"Quite concentrated nose evokes hot year. On the palete drives back to classic blackcurrant, red currant, mint quality. Despite its age and signs of tertiary tobacco, leather, coffee hints, still not completely matured. Its proves also stone fruit freshness and grainy tannins through. Fine plum, cinnamon flavours along balanced and upright character. Even not so complex than 05 or 2000 vintages, long, savoury finish also on the second day. Drink now and through 2025. From tricky vint. really succes. 92+/100."
348,"üçá Another lowly rated vintage that produced some outstanding wines great for drinking today. This producer is frequently a top buy for value in Pessac. üëÅ Mid purple üëÉ Glorious out the traps with lashings of ripe dark fruit almost jammy including plums, damson, cassis - some smokey leather bbq action and a dash of sweet cedar oak. Good balance, high everything‚Äôs the full AATB. No one could possibly buy this and be anything but delighted. D√©lectable finish."
349,"Nose: med+ intensity Palate: dry, med+ acidity, med+ body, med+ alcohol, pronounced intensity, med+ finish Pear, brioche, lime, mandarin, peach, apricot, mango, pineapple, toast, resinous, blossom, honeysuckle Very good quality Drink now. Suitable for further ageing"
350,"Definitely edging towards a 4.5. Lovely rounded body. Full of Cab Franc, evident because Cab Franc smells like green beans to me! Harmoniously balanced acidity and aged in old oak to lend it a velvety softness that is subtle yet tangible. Long finish, fine tannins. Very enjoyable"
351,"Very good consistent finesse Polished offering, sweet aromas of flowers, plum, raspberry vanilla, tobacco and cedar. Lush mouthfeel of smooth tone tannins, offering a full lingering finale. Good value and style, elegant! 4.0‚òÜ delicious, stylish luscious! Bacchus Grand Bordeaux Tour 2019, @ Extrasupertanker Tropicana Gardens Mall. 04.12.2019"
352,"Pessac Leognan 2006 (2/2) - Malartic-Lagravi√®re Surprised how close this wine was with Fieuzal. Almost same Aromas, characteristics and evolution. Given it is 30% more expensive than Fieuzal, Q/P is a bit lower. üëÅÔ∏è: Deep Ruby üëÉ: Medium(+) intensity flavours of blackberry, blueberry, smoke, blackberry jam, leather, ceddar. üëÑ: Dry with high acidity, medium (+) tannins, medium alcohol, full body and long length. ‚è≥: Can drink now and in the next 7 years üí≤: Value for money, 3/5 (40 CHF)"
353,"Quite mature, already with tertiary flavours of animal farm and leather. Still with some fresh berries, cherries, and jam. Medium body, some acid and firm tannic texture. Long and dry finish with a touch of blackcurrant."
354,"Well balance acidity ‚Äì here zingy lime zest ‚Äì builds slowly over the course of the palate, along with good tension and savoury herbs. Grasps on to the available freshness in the grapes and run with it. A lovely wine with freshness. blend of 85% Sauvignon Blanc and 15% Smillon,"
355,"Far too young to fully appreciate yet; the very smooth and fine tannins indicate that this wine‚Äôs best years are in the far future. The oak and vanilla, with a touch of blackberry ice cream on the nose are delightful. The palate is beautifully balanced between the pleasant acidity and tannins, with a medium-long finish. Earthy tones and leather are more prominent on the palate. Great wine."
356,"Deep crimson. Mature nose of ripe berries, herbs, with hint of pinewood. Cassis, floral bouquet, marshland. I had this wine not too long ago and decided to open another bottle (actually my last one) because I believe it has peaked and will unlikely improve further. Drinking very well now, smooth and well balanced. A gentleman wine, just like what a traditional Bordeaux should be. 8 June 2016."
357,"2014 - 90 pts. Deep ruby red. Intense color good clarity. Plum, raisin, jammy fruit aromas with hints of spice and old books. As one expects for a Grand Cru, structure is balanced with med acidity and firm tannin. Not a whole lot going on for me right now, seems a little disjointed. Hard to justify the cost of this over their second wine, which is a fantastic QPR at $20-$25."
358,"Super nice Bordeaux blend this one. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc & Petit Verdot. Deep ruby garnet in color. Berry, cherry and currant fruits backed up by spices and a long finish with nice hints of tobacco. The wood aging is really there, ads texture and richness."
359,"Inky purple, cherry colour. Nose of floral, red fruits, graphite, tobacco, minerals. Beautiful balance medium body wine with soft, subtle acidity. Tannins are mild, refine. Beautiful finish of charcoal, tar, minerals. Ready to drink although 1-1.5 hour of decanting would improve the wine."
360,"üëÅ deep ruby purple üëÉ blackberry, plum, black cherry üçí espresso, soft leather üëÖ rich silky cassis, blackberry, plum and black cherry üçí with subtle baking spice and mocha.

361,"2nd time this month and kicks ass AGAIN! Leather, smoke, earth, black truffle and DARK fruit on the nose (& perhaps a tiny mint thing). For me, this is ready to rock! It's got a perfect balance of concentration, polished, sweet tannins, dark fruit acidity and that beautiful dark matter of smoke, leather, earth, minerality with some black truffle thrown in for good measure. Well structured, plush & thick, this '05's best days could still be ahead, but I'm not waiting to find out! I'm drinking now - 2020!"
362,"She‚Äôs ready! 8/8/2020 yet she will only improve with age. Such a beautiful, rich, cherry red color... fresh, wet berries and graphite on the nose, good structure and acidity. Perhaps a bit too much acidity for my taste but it is so well balanced and such a pleasurable, lingering finish that the bite is forgiven."
363,Blackberry. Flinty. Figs Delicate wine Silky mouthfeel Everything is in balance. No notes take over in a very balanced and refined way Enjoyed w beef Wellington made by Theo at the Picou‚Äôs house. What a dinner.

365,"As good as I remember! The 05‚Äô has plenty of tannin and cellar time left (in 2017). Bouquet of plum, chocolate, cedar, and spices. Lush palate - full bodied and still dry. Benefits from a bit from decanting, opening up nicely. This is fantastic value from the left bank, don‚Äôt miss it!"
366,"Deep inky purple. 4 hr decant reveals dark fruit: baked black plum cassis, menthol, herbs, baking spice, tobacco, flint, ash. Med plus acid med plus tannin med plus 40 sec finish med plus body. Intriguing wine, but give it time. On opening it revealed little of the depth that it showed as it opened up."
367,"The nose starts a bit lactic (cottage cheese), then beautiful ripe fruit, blackberries, cassis combined with cocoa, licorice, tobacco, pepper and vanilla. The palate confirms. Pretty velvety texture, pleasing and smooth."
368,"Early entering its prime now in ‚Äò19. WA-94 at the price of less than $50, a true value-for-money grand cru classe. According to a vineyard representative, it‚Äôs their market position to allow people to enjoy good wine at affordable price. Admirable!"
369,A fantastic wine with aging potential. Tasted blind with 2 other Pessac-L√©ognan 2015 bottles. This was my top pick. Very aromatic with hints of oak and vanilla. I would definitely keep a few bottles.
370,"My first but not last I hope. Needed a long time in the decanter before it opened up. But then it gave a way red berries, blueberry, plums and figs. The mouthfeel was pleasant with flavors from the nose and some spiced black fruits. Long aftertaste."
371,"An underrated 2011 vintage, partially living in the shadows of the legendary '09 and '10 vintages. 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Franc, 3% Petit Verdot, 20 months in oak, 60% new. Appearance: deep ruby Nose: blackcurrant, blackcurrant leaves, herbaceous notes, plum Palate: tannins are still very chewy and gripping. Merlot is much needed to even it out but it makes the wine a bit too plummy. Very high acidity, medium [+] finish"
372,"Intend to 3choose this 14.5% cab base for serious steak night. Very good aroma,first note of wet gravel and ripe fruit then creamy note with some oak.remaining sense of ripe fruit and wet gravel on palate with alchohol.dry full body.moderate finish. Young good grave."

375,"Aromas of black fruits, spices, oak. On the palate, silky creamy kind of meaty blood felted, this is the first time I felt it like meaty. I drank this half bottle for like 9 hours and stills good at the end üòÅüëçü•Ç hkd 258 (0.375)"

378,"Of the 2015 Bordeaux‚Äôs I have had the pleasure of tasting already - almost straight out the cask - this is the most soft and ‚Äòfeminine‚Äô of the lot. Still very intense and rich, but with softer tannin and a more refined fruit. As for all of the 2015 so far - very very good!"
379,"Chateau Malartic Lagarieve 2006 Vintage Nice meld of tannic character riding on spicy roasted cassis, peaking to a bouquet of saturated dense bouquet. Smooth texture, bulbous palate of fine tannins, tapering to a nice grippy note"
380,"Classic Bordeaux with still grip and a hint of acidity. Deep ruby color, viscosity, aromatic with black fruits, leather and tobacco. Round tannins, dry palate with medium to full body. Flavors of black fruits, smoke and oak. Long finish."
381,"Well balanced wine. Soothing. Deep garnet Very expressive aroma of black fruit, cassis Full body, smooth tannins Very fruity Cassis, red fruit on palate at first, with hints of spice. Open up after some breathing, mushroom, truffle. Medium finish with hints of vanilla. Creamy ending"
382,"On the nose, typical Cabernet profiles: (cassis, black current leaves, smoke/ tobacco) but also hint of lavender when aired. Black berry on palate, vanilla, dark plum and cedar. Soft tannins. Very good"
383,"Hangi tasted the 09 Malartic a couple of days ago and inspired me to buy some. A friend gave the 14 to me (for cellaring). So I thought It would be a good idea to try how it is since I have not tried it before. Obviously too young but one could imagine how it will develop. Black cherries and blue berries, leather and some herbs. A gentle sweetness behind a curtain of strong tannins and med+ acidity. Finishs long but rather adstringent. Give it another ten years and it will be beautiful. Gonna buy 09. 4,0"
384,"Deep red color with hints of purple. Pencil, dark fruit and leather at the nose. Rich velvethy moutfill of black currant, plum, dark cherry developing into cigar and black tea flavors as time pas. Well integrated tannines."
385,"I prefer their white, but this is also good. Quite typical for the appellation, but a bit modern and polished by Michel Rolland. Pleasant bouquet of blackberries, cassis, plum, milk chocolate, coffee beans. Well balanced and structured, mature tannins, round, almost full bodied, yet not heavy. Hiding its true character."
386,"Deep red to purple colour and good legs. Strong nose of cassis. On the palate blackcurrant and a little cherry. Took about 2 hours to open up in the decanter, but was then beautifully smooth. The Cabernet Sauvignon flavours really come out. I really liked this wine."
387,"A gourmand Pessac, full-bodied and well structured. Generous red fruits, with notes of nicely oaked vanilla. Sugared spices. Persistent finish. A pure pleasure. Pricing doesn‚Äôt share too much value with the consumer though..."
388,"Celebrated restaurateur Charles Masson from La Grenouille just opened a new restaurant Majorelle, in The Lowell hotel on the UpEast w/little garden, library - clubroom w/fireplace & a bar ....

389,"Taut, fresh, spicy, racy, cool and minty. I guessed this was St Estephe: Calon S√©gur. Turns out it was the Pessac! D‚ÄôOh. #67fromhome Bdx blind tasting. Drinking wonderfully just now - many wines from 2010 are ready it seems."
390,"Ch√¢teau Malartic-Lagravi√®re Pessac-L√©ognan 2016 is a youthfully complex red Bordeaux that needs more time in the bottle for full appreciation while it still offers good balance and intensity. Sniffing it brings out black currant, blackberry, vanilla, tobacco, cocoa, wet earth, and smoke, which comes through on the palate along with the high tannins. The wine pairs brilliantly with a medium rare ribeye served with a foie gras bordelaise sauce, as tannin and flavors complements the dish. Exquisite!"
391,"Medium bodied. Garnet colour with nose of dark cherries, earth and light smoke. Super silky in the mouth with sweets notes of plums and cassis.Medium tannins and slightly higher acidity. A must have if you like wines on the slightly sweeter side."
392,Gift from a friend. Was really looking forward to this one. Having a 4+ wine is rare for me. It is good but not that good. Maybe expectations were too high. Much better on the 2nd day. Tastes of vanilla. Had it with Rahul Singh
393,"3.9 Here we have notes as tabacco, plum, black pepper, liquorice, blackberry, blackcurrant and vanilla. Sweetness: dry Acidity: high Tannins: high Alcohol: high Body: full Intensity: high Finish length: long"
394,"Although they lost 30-50% of their crop due to frost, the 2017 wine hast turned out to be one of the best red Graves shown at the En Primeurs. With 65% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Merlot in the Grand Vin, it received high marks from the critics. Lovely, concentrated nose, with great freshness. On the palate round and full, with great complexity. Ripe tannins, leading to a long finish."
395,"3,9 SUAVE. Another pessac-leognan blend. The wine has a very compelling and inviting nose of black fruit, cocoa and light smoke. The palate is soft round with a concentration and richness in ripe fruit as well as some savory notes. Very balanced in its acidity/tannins equilibrium. Overall worth is price tag. Once again... tasting a good year is the next step."
396,"Concentrated and spicy, this is full of generous tannins and delicious black plum and vanilla. Spice goes with a toasty, wood aging flavours that enhance the opulent texture of this delicious, young wine. Needs time."
397,Amazingly approachable for a 2015!
398,"Unarguably a very good pessac absolutely in the peak window I would say but the roteboeuf is a tough act to follow despite ‚Äòobviously‚Äô feeling more youthful and grippy. Good combination of black and red primary fruit, with nice tertiary notes vanilla and spice, medium acidity and tannin. Does everything really well but just doesn‚Äôt attempt to pull on the heart strings. A wine you could serve up and all would enjoy without too much comment. Solid."
399,"4,0+ Blend of CS, Merlot, CF and PV (52/40/5/3) from Pessac-L√©ognan with 18m ageing in FO barrels (~65% new). Med. ruby color, some garnet hints. Med-high intensity on the nose. Aromas of smoke, oak, a lot of forest fruis: raspberry, blueberry, black currant, cranberry, barrel, clay, toast, cinnamon, charcoal. On the palate dry, high acidity, alcohol well integrated, med. body, med+ fine tannins, med. flavor intensity, med+ finish, sour cherry, charcoal, barrel and mineral taste. Still youthful‚§µÔ∏è"
400,"It would be 5* in few years time. But this 2005 is an impeccable and elegant beauty to drink even now. Rich and dense. Super rich in dark blackberries and cassis. Medium body and moderate tannin. Nose üëÉ tobacco, blackberry, truffle and mocha Taste üëÑ blackberries, cassis, pepper, vanilla, smoke, toast Pure joy"
401,"2014: Delightful nectar, this left bank Bordeaux rocks and shows how good Graves wines can be, even young !"
