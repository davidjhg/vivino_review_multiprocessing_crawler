1,"Great 2005 Bordeaux from Ch√¢teau Smith Haut Lafite, fabulous fruit aromas & great length, depth, structure & finesse, the big 2005 vintage shows nice maturity at 14 years"
2,"2012 vintage dark ruby in color, almost as opaque as ink, blackberry, red cherry and earthy aromas and tastes, firm tannins give it a wonderful structure that is very balanced. it needs quite a while to breathe. if you taste it immediately after opening and the in an hour or two later you will be amazed at the difference."
3,"Leathery nose, soft , accessible. Amazing for such young wine."
4,"Taste this on 2020 Bordeaux En Primeur. Concentrated black fruit, with deep structure and strength, balancee by long lasting cedar and smooth tannin."
5,"2009 vintage, still young and vigorous. Beautiful fruity aromas with black current, black cherries, sweet baking spices and herbal notes."
6,great with abt 30min decanting. grass earth nose. very viscous an think. full bodied. nicely aged wine but i was expecting more from this winery
7,"Intense and pure nose of black currant and blackberry. The palate is dry and medium bodied with firm, fine tannins and a clean, fresh and persistent black fruit finish"
8,Very powerful. Lots of prunes and chocolate. Really love this wine just a bit sad to see how the price went so high.
9,"A vertical tasting of shl with M. Cathiard himself, thanks to Bacchus Geneve for another great evening!"
10,"Although i am more of an Italian wine fan, this is one of my favorite french wines. Classic Bordeaux red blend (has a nice touch of cabernet franc and petit verdot), it has an excellent acidity and wonderful structure, quite tight, showing a little cedar. Juicy red fruit, concentrated black fruits."
11,"Wow. You want a long lasting, amalgamation of flavor? How about pleasant smoke, earth, truffle, dark fruits, leather as well. Amazing showing from Bordeaux and probably the best wine you can buy without destroying your wallet. Please decant this younger wine to bring out a slew of new flavors, and I imagine aging this would be a pleasure to experience."
12,Excellent bourdeaux 2010 vintage. Best bourdeaux I have had ever.
13,vanilla blackcurrant tobacco leather oak
14,"4,1‚≠êÔ∏è 2020 Chateau Smith Haut Lafite, Pessac Leognan Bordeaux En Primeur tasting Without notes"
15,One of my favorites
16,"Rich and full, too much fruit? Very good."
17,"At first young, acidic flavour but after-taste is fantastic with a hint of vintage, cask-y taste."
18,Excellent concentrated sophisticated
19,"Incredible wine, maybe a little difficult and unusual vanilla leather earthy"
20,Enjoy The day with Brazilians drinking French
21,Lovely nose of black currant and blackberry.
22,Great body fruity
23,"Excellent wine , full body , taste of wood and cigar"
24,Gorgeous tobacco with blackcurrent
25,"18 June 2021 @ Christy‚Äôs - 97 vintage, goes well with SEA food"
26,"Stunning. Went on a wine tasting at the domaine which is a must do while visiting Bordeaux. Silky, deep but yet sophisticated wine üç∑ with aroma of leather blackberry tobacco chocolate vanilla earthy"
27,Disappointing. Harsh tannins and not very well balanced. The 2011 at least did not live up to the price tag.
28,"Grapefruit and minerals, pretty yummy"
29,"Beautiful aged Bordeaux. Full of leather, earth, graphite, and dark fruit flavors. Bright acidity and a long finish. Its hard to beat good Old Bordeaux. 4.4"
30,"Has wonderful richness and suppleness, lovely fruit and harmony. A superb example of a graceful, balanced wine that is delicious now. Lots going on here."
31,"One 2005 deserves another. A great producer also known for its white gems, this is in a lovely phase. Black fruit core, juicy acidity, ripe tannins, excellent flavour intensity and length."
32,"Apricots, nutmeg and a great mix between a rich full mouth feel and a vein of salinity running through this Bordeaux Blanc. Well integrated alcohol and a finish that lasted ages."
33,"""La canicule"" was dubbed the 2003 Bordeaux vintage, referring to the heatwave and often overripe and not suitable for aging wines. Not so for this wonderful Smith Haut Lafitte, that is drinking perfectly now. Typical Cabernet aromas of cassis, blackberry, blackcurrant leaf, bell pepper, as well as typical aged Bordeaux aromas of cedar, cigar box, tobacco, leather and trifle. Very complex and seductive. Smooth but structured and with a long finish, this is aged Bordeaux as it should be."
34,"A blend of 62/30/6/2 Cab Sauv/Merlot/Cab Franc/Petit Verdot. Aged 18m in 60% new oak. Deep ruby. Pronounced aroma intensity. V. rich & ripe w. plump blackberry, blackcurrant, black cherry, a touch of eucalyptus & opulent creamy oak spice. An underlying mineral earthy note adds elegance. Youthful. Dry. Fresh & ripe w. plush black fruits (blackcurrant, blackberry, damson) & vanilla-infused oak spice, liquorice & mocha. Concentrated, full bodied with high acid, high tannins & a delicious long finish. Superb!"
35,Interestingly a very similar nose to the Charbonnaux we just had with smoke and litchees. But the main difference is that the body is also completely in line with the nose and that is amazing. Rounder and not acid. Random interesting fact: the chateau makes its own barrels!
36,"Chateau Smith Haut Lafite 2005 (TY, CRCLR, JUN19). Deep color. First, outstanding nose of sweet ripe fruit jumping up from the glass: raspberry, black currant, black cherry, blueberry aromas intertwined beautifully with leather, pepper, licorice and forest floor. Harmonious and balanced, good grip, with vivacious velvet tannins. Medium to full bodied. Fresh and complex, with layers of indulging fruits and pleasant lingering finish."
37,"Dates back to the Crusades & Scottish navigator, George Smith, 18th century owner, followed by M. Duffour-Dubergier, Mayor of Bordeaux, then Louis Eschenauer, wine shipper. In 1990, Daniel & Florence Cathiard now own estate. A blend of 62% Cab Sauv, 30% Merlot, 6% Cab Franc, & 2% Petit Verdot. Dark red with dark berry fruit aromas, cedar, smoke and sweet spice. Palate, rich & complex ripe black fruit flavors, oak & cacao. Firm rich tannins, full, lingering, rustic, spice, perfect balance. L-T aging."
38,"Happy National Wine Day to all, the Smith Haut Lafite is simply delicious, at the age of 15 the wine is at its peak with an enchanting nose of: black fruit, black plum, ash, beef broth, baking spice, cedar, cigar box, espresso, earth , medium to full body, with a touch dry well integrated tannins, sublime acidity and a long delicious lingering finish of coffee and earth, my score 93, drink to 2021"
39,"4.3‚≠êÔ∏è Such a consistent producer. The 2016 was mindblowing last year, 2015 very good and 2017 again one of the best in the tasting. Well balanced and highly intens with the characteristic and profound toast note that hazes all other flavours. Cherry üçí, cassis and bacon fat in a creamy texture with full concentration, definitely compared to its peers, showing already a good deal of complexity. üëèüëè #UGCB2020"

44,"This is a Bordeaux you can really sink your teeth into! You get lots of black currant and other dark fruit, with earth and smokey leather. The texture has fine strong tannins with a nice lingering finish. Sitting on my '06...!"
45,"Oh my, this was so nice. This was our top pick of the night, and it beat out other bottles much more expensive. The wine is beginning to come together very nicely and showing fantastic complexity in the nose and body. We both picked up a bit of anise on the nose and palate, which I really like. After looking it up I also found that the price is hard to beat as well at $85 compared to what I found on wine-searcher. Great now, but I can see this becoming even better later."
46,My first 100 pointer and it was great! Unfortunately served after 6 other bottles. No formal notes kept.
47,"From a magnum: chocolate, tobacco, leather, earth, it opened up quite a bit after 3 hours of decanting. Tannins are well balanced."
48,"I love Pessac! Mouthfeel is not as silky as I would want from Pessac, but the fruit is fantastic! Needs another 6 to 8 years!"
49,"So pronounced and powerful of tropical fruit like pineapple, melon, high acidity and linhering finish. Outstanding bordeaux white."
50,In such a perfect stage of its life. Its got that classic bordeaux appeal and my god its trying to flaunt itself. Drinking now- 2021.
51,"What surprise! The difficult 2013 did not affect haut-lafitte if this is anything to go by. Full of fruits and silky smooth, simply a stunning wine"

60,Absolutely amazing wine. Smooth. Dark fruit and earth. Light tannin. One of the best wines I have ever had. Would definitely drink again.

98,"This was another fantastic bottle on a crazy wine journey tonight. It could use more age for sure, but drank amazing! So glad to share with DrFly."
99,"Deeper yellow than expected. Fruity with ever so slight hints of truffles and Forrest mushrooms. Opening palate of salty plums, earthy herbs and intense flowers."
100,Every bottle and vintage is a treasure to discover. Excellent nose of dark forest fruit with a hint of leather and a beatiful midium body . Long aftertaste
101,"Had it one year later after the last tasting. Having matured longer, it shows more complexity with notes of cream, nuts, vanilla, honey and perfume. Very enjoyable."
102,"Deep cherry nose. Mature and juicy. plum, tobacco, and blackberry in the mouth. 2005 is a great year for this wine. Still potential for an even better performance."
103,"Rubric : Bordeaux üá´üá∑ RP - 95 , my - 4.4 üç∑ Bordeaux blend üçá Cassis , tobacco , pencil lead , herbs üåø Medium body , gentle tannins Classic & always correct ! üëç"
104,"Molasses, treacle, mushroom, cocoa powder on the nose. Mocha, blueberry, dusty tannins on the palate. Simply sensational young but this would be a cracker in a decade"
105,After 19 years still very bright wine. Took a while to open up. Fruit is forward but in balance. Delicious. Medium body. Elegant finish. Tannins are still strong
106,"Decant for 1 hour. Very very nice flowery nose. Palate is jammy with a lot of complexity dominate by red fruit, cherry and rasberries with aoft silky tannin."
107,Despite the vintage which is below average this wine is shining. Soft tannins and a full bodied style with tremendous many layers of black fruit. Now and until 2030
108,"Plum, vanilla and smoke flavor. Refreshing minerals, cherry, red currant and pepper taste. Interesting. Light astringent, but very pleasant aftertaste"
109,"Very dark and almost opaque. Very pronounced nose of ink, graphite, blackberries, leather, game, coffee, cream and oak. Very rich and fully bodied. Long aging potential."

115,"Deep ruby in color. On the nose plum jam, leather, tobacco, oak, and very light smoke. The palate follows the nose along with light hints of almond. Extremely good wine !! 4.3"
116,Together with Pape clement they are among the best 2012 Bordeaux left bank wines after the first growth. Slightly younger less complex than Pape Clement now but it has the depth and longevity.
117,"Very deeply coloured, black core. Lifted, dark fruit and notes of mocha. Oaky on the nose. Dense tannins, sweet fruit in the middle, plus some vanilla sweetness, but the end is pretty dry."

134,"A close 2nd behind the 2000 for me. Wines from the Chateau, courtesy of the Cathiards. Was told that this was the last Magnum in the Chateau. Layers complexity, expressing it's own every mouthful."
135,"Amazing Bordeaux! Dry, medium body with notes of blackberry, plum, damp earth and tobacco. Graphite cedar and toasted oak on the finish. Full but approachable tannin. A treat!"
136,Wow what a great wine! Deep full bodied red. Leather tobacco chocolate red fruits! Still plenty of tannins and power to age a couple of years. This wine just screams for red meat (and a bbq)

140,Black fruits with a hint of lather and oak. A great wine... one of the best. The only problem it was murdered at an early age :) it could have aged smooth 15-20 years...
141,Enjoyed at Wine Spectators NY Wine Experience 2017! Superb. Blackberry and blueberry pie. Tannic but is well balanced with the racey acidity. This draws out more of the secondary flavor notes.
142,"Deep ruby red color with pronounced strawberry, coffee, cedar. medium+ silky tannins, medium+ acidity, full body and medium+ finish. Was bottle decant for 1 hr and transfer into decanter later."
143,"Rich wine, made in a popular oaked style. Remarkable ripeness and softness, especially compared to it's neighbors. Well balanced and pure. Chocolate and leather. Of course a bit young, will develop"
144,"Wow nice! Pleasantly surprised as Colour was brickly red at the first pour and got worried for a while... very forward fruits, leather mocha vanilla oak. Very smooth with silky tannin, Good length. Half star short as it feels a tad too hot at the end of it which lingers in the palette."
145,"Revisiting this attractive Pessac-Leognan rouge last tasted few years back. Great bold, luscious mouthfeel. Palate is expressive with loads of earthy, cassis, leather characters intermixed with good concentration of dark fruits, blackcurrant, blackberry and sweet plums."
146,"üëÄ: Very nice dark color üëÉ: On the nose are plums, toast, blackcurrant and cream. Slight vanilla and caramel as well, sweet nose. üëÖ: In the mouth it is juicy with fresh plum and blackcurrant fruit, silky tannins do dry things out a little and fruit to persist. Excellent wine"
147,"Wow not many words needed! 4.3‚≠êÔ∏è even this left bank Bordeaux is still young it has this very rich and tasty nose if dark fruits, spices, tobacco and vanilla. On the palate very structured andc complex with aromas of blackberries, black cherries, tobacco, earth, spices and slightly vanilla. Very juicy and long lasting finish! Cheers üç∑"
148,"Fine focussed nose- lifted and beautifully scented. Power and elegance personified on the palate. Lots of power, loads of backbone. Fine tannins and beautifully balanced. I love this estate. Always memorable wines."
149,"If you can, don‚Äôt drink it in 2019 yet. I expect it to further develop. If you open it now, let it breath. Dark red, almost black color, but less dense than other years. Tremendous black fruit, blackberry and leather in the nose. Initially very earthy notes that become lighter after it‚Äôs been open for some hours. On the palette silky, yet with crisp tannins and again blackberry as well as black cherry and leather. Long finish."
150,"How can such a young white deliver such length? Still young, not as interesting as I remember the last 2010. But the sheer intensity, fruit, citrus, emerging peach and the long finsh earns the high score today.#keepifyoucanimightfail"
151,"Wood, spices, vanilla, forest floor, dainty red berries, blackberry, forest berries and green herbs. Extremely delicious! Soft and rounded attack. Wow. Delicious notes of ripe cherry, wood, vanilla, red forest berries, forest floor and sweet prunes. Great complex midpalate still vibrant and interesting with fresh fruit. The finish reveals the age of the wine. Mellow fruit but still with vibrant freshness and fine balance. 96"
152,"Dark red core moving to a ruby rim. The nose is very expressive, with notes of licorice, banana pepper, graphite, blackberry, and blueberry. Medium plus body with velvety tannins, and a lingering finish. This bottle will drink well for a LONG time, and is early in its development, but still stunning."
153,"Deep inky purple ruby colour with great legs. Nose of blackberries, cassis, mocha and black currant leaf. Palate is solid, still fairly primary, juicy black fruits, beautifully integrated tannins, well balanced acidity... with an epic finish. Should be good for another 20 years"
154,"Despite the cork's substantial disintegration on cautious opening,the wine,once decanted,opened up fast.10mins in the initially muted nose exhibits red fruits,dried tobacco,cedar,leather and that classic Bordeaux earthiness that only develops after significant bottle age.30mins in a floral note joins in together with hints of orange peel.Palate: blackberry,redcurrant,graphite,earth,tobacco,mineral,spice(gentle).Medium-bodied,supple mouthfeel,evolving,long drying finish.For me,fantastic.Need more space!"
155,4.3. Very enjoyable wine. Balanced. Not overly complex. We had these between 2014 Titus Cabernet and 2011 Pontet-Canet and it was a nice bridge. Not worth the price to me but served as a nice comparison to the Pontet-Canet. Same vintage. Showed how much more complex a left-bank red could/should be.
156,"Had a bottle of this for giggles after trying a glass of the ‚Äò12... much tighter and more structured, started to come in to its own after 2 hours in the bottle (Georgia‚Äôs bath and bed time!)... beautiful wine, more savory notes (very old rosemary, crunchy autumn leaves) to go with the wonderful fruit... on all honesty, too early for this one... needs time..."
157,"Probably the finest wine I‚Äôve tried from Smith Haute Lafitte. Full bodied, concentrated and has such great balance and build for aging. Black, inky depths with with blueberry, blackcurrants and blackberry notes seasoned with plenty of spices and herbs. Chocolate and roasting herbs, graphite snd tar. Suffice to say the wine gave off a broad spectrum, an array of complex layers that was gripping. And it has the spine to age well. Tasted 2019 with the Cathiards on the chateau grounds."
158,Pencil lead meat bbq. The kind of wine that reminds you why spending money on Brodeaux is well worth it. That's all you need to know. üëÄStarting to look a little bricky at the edges üëÉpronounced nose. Sweet and deep. Very minerally. Fairly dense black fruit with that lovely classic pencil coming through. üëÖperfect balance. Lovely bbq pit for your mouth. So long. Bing bang boom.
159,"Dark and inky, almost black. Nose is a bit muted largely because this wine is still sleepy! Lots of time yet to enjoy this one. Dark fruit with black cherries and plums opening up to cocoa and spices. Absolutely loved this wine! Open now or take your time."
160,"The wine has a beautiful, shiny dark ruby color. The wine has a concentrated, well-balanced taste with notes of strawberries and gooseberries, nuances of licorice, vanilla and pepper, silky tannins and a long, enchanting aftertaste. The complex aroma of the wine reveals notes of ripe red fruits, in particular, raspberries and cherries, which are replaced by nuances of dry herbs, licorice, cloves, anise, smoke and caramel."
161,"There we go! First impression of toasted bread, afterwards blackberries, cassis and tabacco. On the palate actually quite shy, but super round, dry and a smooth tannin. Honestly one of the best french reds I have had so far (I know it hasn't been thst much yet). A highly complex wine that I wouldn't drink for a dinner, you better enjoy it solo! The only negative point is the price...but I will leave that up to you."
162,"Had at the Sotheby's Bordeaux Grand Crus Event - a 2015 Bordeaux Horizontal Tasting. Love the nose of black and red fruits, wood, and minerality - its very well integrated and almost seductive. Palate is rich with black fruits, chocolate, liquorice and espresso coming together very nicely. Med+ tannin and acid makes this wine age worthy, but very nice to enjoy right now. A tad pricey, but I would splurge on this..."
163,Smith Haut Lafitte. Pessac-Leognan 2015 vintage. 2nd time drinking. 2nd time in love! That smoky oaky nose! Very hard to find fault with this one... Aroma: oak tobacco blackberry plum smoke coffee Palate: dark fruit chocolate cedar vanilla berry jam Salivating and delicious long finish with fine tannins. Restocking for my own pleasure.
164,"Deep ruby colour. Aromas of dark cherry, blackcurrant, leather, cigar box, oak, coffee, chocolate, some herbaceousness licorice. Palate is medium+ acidity, full body, medium+ alcohol, tannins are stromg and still a bit green, great balance, long finish. An excellent classic, elegant, fine, one of my Bordeaux favourites. A great year too!"
165,"Wow!! This was everything i had hoped for. Lively nose of damp earth, blackcurrant, Dominican tobacco, dried plum, saddle leather, Indian spices and licorice that follow trough to a full- bodied palate , with silky tannins and a long ,long lasting length. Very pretty indeed, all in finesse!!"
166,"4.3 I rarely drink Bordeaux, but tonight I wanted to try some matured Bordeaux. I read a lot of positive reviews about this chateau, but actually never tried it, so tonight I opened this wonderful matured SHLüòã So smoothüôèüòçüá´üá∑üç∑üëå"
167,"A blend of 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 36% Merlot and 8% Cabernet Franc. Elegant and smoky nose with blackberry, violet and licorice aromas. Full-bodied. Very good structure. Just a little tannin but softening nicely. Very good grip and distinction. On the palate, this is smooth, plump, generous and harmonious. Accessible. Very good vigor and complexity. Lovely long finish."
168,"Clear and medium garnet in color with noticeable fine sediments. Freshly uncorked, there were vibrant aromas of blackberry, dark plum, dark chocolate and a hint of leather. Three hours of aeration in the bottle spawned complexities of black olives, soil, smoke and cigar boxes. The mouthfeel was dry, full and gently spiced, with medium balanced acidity and a medium to high level of integrating tannin. Flavors of preserved fruit and mint, transitioning into toast, truffles. 4.5‚Äºüëå"
169,It took a bit of time for this bottle to open up. I am a bit disappointed as SHL is one of my favourite chateaux and this vintage is sublime. The previous 3 SHL 98 I drank were near perfection with this characteristic floral note. I did not find the same here. May be the conservation was not proper. May be the wine passed its peak or entered a downcycle. Don t know.
170,"Deep impenetrable inky red/purple colour. Gorgeous aromatics of scorched earth, roasted meat, blackberry, Blackcurrant, shaved lead pencil and fine cedary oak. You can really smell the ""creosote"" smell that Parker sometimes mentions in his reviews. Medium bodied with vibrant blackcurrant, subtle leafy notes, crisp acidity and fine grained (ripe) tannins. A touch of astringency perhaps from the oak. Cork 13.0% alc."
171,"Initially it showed pronounced baked barrel and popcorn smell of oak and then good blossom, plum and coffee. Very round and full body with ripe and smooth tannin. Supple and ""sweet"" with mouthful aroma and long finish. I like it!"
172,"Very nice Bordeaux from Graves. Probably one of the better. Very smooth long nice tannins. Works great with sirloin, even in Korean bbQ"
173,"We opened it an hour ago and so far... It's amazing how a 40 year old wine still feels alive and in good condition ...!!! Full cork in good condition, the color is a dark orange brick and the first aromas are those of moisture, mud and moss. In the mouth, there‚Äôs an incredible silky feel, notes of leather, tobacco and a light and very fine acidity still present. I think this wine has definitely had better years in the past, their evolution is slow but on the rise, as an elegant great wine."
174,"This wine üç∑ never disappoints, I know it‚Äôs not the best Bordeaux year but still‚Ä¶ wow üòØ balance, structure and TERROIR!!!! Medium üëÉ with a fantastic long and layered finish!! Licorice fig cherry üçí animal ü¶í chocolate üç´ cigar box üì¶ smoke üí® dried herbs üåø and spices‚Ä¶. Probably going to drink another bottle in autumn üçÇ highly recommended"
175,"Alluring, very clean and precise nose of spiced blueberry and black cherry, vanilla, and cedar. The mouth is richly and decadently fruity and full bodied but manages to stay energetic and lively. Deep cherry and red apple flavors shine. The tannins are edgy and very grippy. The finish is very long, but a bit linear, bitter and sort of flat, and is the only part of this wine that is slightly off. Damn near perfect in my book. 4.7/5 erring more toward 4.5. Keep this one in the cellar for quite a while longer."
176,"They say 2012 was an average year for Bordeaux, but not for This exceptional Chateau! the only thing affected was that it was easier to drink for young Wine like this one ! Strong Aromatic , on the palate chocolate and dark fruits, with a long long finish! Loved it !"
177,"Opening my Christmas gift for my birthday celebration. Explosive nose leading with aromas of leather, hay barn and musty cellar. Behind that slowly unfolding notes of prune, espresso beans, tobacco, truffle. This 18 yo beast is as delicious as it is intense. Velvety structure with powerful body, juicy acidity and fading, soft tannins. One of the longest finishes I‚Äôve ever tasted. Drink this now as it won‚Äôt hold up for too long. Complements of my wife, Steven Joe and Dale"
178,Outstanding. Almost black appearance in the glass. Huge cigar box and forest floor alongside great black currant and blueberry fruit on the nose. It has a very linear profile but with broadness on the palate. Elegant and long and at the same time deep and uplifting on the finish. Lovely üòä
179,"Merry Christmas Vlad Bohdanov! Funky nose of earthy mushrooms with red and black fruits. Elegant on the palate, tannins softened , black cherries and ripe red cherries and strawberries. Wow"
180,"(4,4) Fantastic minerality here that makes this a standout wine. Toasty. Vanilla, mushrooms, tobacco. Fragrant. Fine-grained tannins, slight sweetness to them, but also lots of freshness in the wine. Brambles, cocoa. Lots of balance. Lengthy. @UGCB tasting, Amsterdam"
181,"Slowly bt breathed for 2 hrs, first bt from a case, cool nose of cassis, cedar and menthol. Very smooth but concentrated on palate, bit closed, have plenty of potential as all elements of a great bdx is present. Try in another 5 yrs."
182,"Having a second go at this SHL 08 for Bordeaux Sunday 08 is proving to be a stubborn vintage-but I decanted it‚Äôs into submission Then it rewards you Deep purple, cigar box, crushed rocks and pencil shavings Full powerful cassis, dark cherry & blueberry Ground tobacco, coffee & bitter chocolate Earth, liquorice, pencil shavings, cedar, big tannic structure, big spice Yesss 4.3 heading to 4.5 Happy Bordeaux Sunday ü•∞üëçüèøüç∑"
183,"4.4@ Korean thanksgiving day2 Quite solid, dark ruby. Really concentrated aroma of cigar, cinnamon, dark chocolate and vanilla. Wet forest, well aged leather, licorice and some blackfruites like blackberry - very strong fruits on nose after mid note. Explosive! Lively but decent enough. Heavy body, soft velvety tannin. Well orginized acidity, too. Impressive long finish, pretending to stay forever in vin yard.. Powerful elengance. ÏãúÏùåÏ†ÅÍ∏∞Ïóê Îì§Ïñ¥ÏÑ∞Îã§ÎçîÎãà.... ÌïòÏßÄÎßå 10ÎÖÑÌõÑ ÎßõÏùÄ Îòê Ïñ¥Îñ®Íπå?"
184,"Simple tannins when it 1st opened. Decanted for an hour, it became wonderful after being softened. Oaky at the beginning follows by truffle, black cherry smoky n dark chocolate. Full bodied rounded texture. Very good long finished but slightly less complexity. Drink in another 5-10 years will be much better. Tasted March 2019. 94/100."
185,"I've been saving this bottle for a while and I'm so happy to crack it open tonight. Serving with steak grilled asparagus and sweet potato. Color is a dark crimson with rustic edges on the glass rim. Super juicy plums and blueberries.... Dark chocolate,. All spice and vanilla. This wine has aged so well... Tight grippy tannins pull all the flavors together which are balanced very well. There's a long finish with an elegance that just makes you think of when the wine was made. Great wine 92 pts qpr $70."
186,"Tasting mode, so without regard to P/Q. Just great in its fine elegance. Really sexy with elusive sweet note on the beautiful base of ripe red and dark berries with dozen of nuances that should be familiarize in small good company. Absolutely enjoyable right now and promises great development in future. One of the most attractive wine of this tasting."
187,"Enjoyed at Max BDX. This is a brooding deep purple. Savoury nose, full of meat, fruit and a touch of mint. On the attack the wine bowls you over with its clear black fruit profile, the structure/weight of the wine carries through the palate with a full 1 minute clean finish. Gorgeous 94 Points."
188,Retrying this wine again 6 years later and it is showing very well. Fragrant nose of red and black fruits. Perfect integration with nice balance and med body. Med length finish. Paired with steak frites.
189,"Located in the Pessac-L√©ognan and classified as a ‚ÄòGrand Cru Class√© de Graves‚Äô, the winery has been producing some outstanding wines recently üçá The 2017 vintage (rouge) is no exception and consists of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 35% Merlot, 4% Cabernet Franc and 1% Petit Verdot üìù On the palate it shows aromas of fresh red fruits, liquorice and spices. Tannins are silky and ripe combined with a fresh finish. This is on my En Primeur 2017 List! üì∑ #AlpineCellar"
190,"Perfectly balanced with classic aromas of blackcurrants, plums, graphite, which are laced by dried flowers and cigar box. The balance between the tannins, the sweet fruit and the acidity is incredible. The long aftertaste reveals tar and earthy notes."
191,What a beautiful specimen. We bottle breathed it for 1/2 hour. First glass was gripping yet with a crystal clear intensity of flavor and treble. As it breathed everything softened up and displayed even more finesse. Rich aromas and fruit concentration. Awesome!
192,"Love this wine and the winery! 62% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30%Merlot, 6% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot Ch√¢teau Smith Haut Lafitte 2014 offers a beautiful dark bright red colour. Its expressive nose reveals very fresh notes of cassis with a hint of smoke. The attack in mouth is fresh and balanced with a fleshy and unctuous texture. The wine is a subtle balance between maturity and freshness. The aromatic is characterised by the freshness with red fruits, spices notes of liquorice and dry herbs. 4,5/5"
193,"4.4 - Five hour decant. Deep dark magenta color. Cherry preserves, walnut, violet and raisins with their stems on the rich nose. Smooth, tongue drying palate with good acidity. Firm, but modest tannins on the long finish. Beautiful wine with terrific depth of character and expressiveness."
194,"2014 Grand Cru - an excellent bottle of Bordeaux served with beef tenderloin and all the trimmings this Thanksgiving. Had a nice time enjoying the company of our kids with a fine meal and wine. Smooth drinking black fruit, plum, blackberry with oak and light vanilla on the finish. Tannins are still pretty prominent. Happy Thanksgiving! 14% ABV - 4.25"
195,"4.2 Deep and intensive with a lot of cassis and other black fruits, black currant Jam, light berry sweetness with soft touch of minerality and graphite, coffee and tobacco, spices. Still enough tannic."
196,"Excellent Bordeaux! A rich and elegant blend of mainly Cabernet Sauvignon (62%), Merlot (30%), Cabernet Franc (6%) and a bit of Petit Verdot (2%), aged 18 months on lees in French oak barrels (60 % new). Bold, complex and deep, with great acidity and length. Deep ruby color, dark fruits aroma/flavors, specially black currant and blackberry, with notes of leather, cedar, cassis, spices, menthol and well integrated oak. Medium+ body, firm polished tannins and a long tasty finish. Classy red, still growing!"
197,One of my favorite left bank Bordeaux. First of all one can feel that strong graphite aftertaste that only few chateau can brag. Very cold and restrained in the beginning with soil and tobacco noted it becomes more soft and fruity after decanting representing French plum and blackberry but still keeping it‚Äôs elegant oaky aftertaste.
198,"Beautiful gold colour, med + intensity, starts with a bit petrol(!), marmalade, honey, dried pineapple, citrus peel, med acid, med+ alc, med+ body, very long finish! Similar flavours as nose on palette with more citrus notes. Love it!"
199,"Great bouquet of blackberry jam, floral notes and fine smoke. Medium body with an amazing texture and a dense concentration. All is at the right place here, mellow tannins and a perfect integrated acid. Plenty of ripped dark berries, black chocolate, sweet spice, tar and cedar. The finish is very long and impressive. Delicious prime drinking but much better in a view years. Can‚Äôt remember enjoyed a better vintage of SHL than this marvellous 2005. A top Pessac-L√©ognan with a very promising future, bravo!!!"
200,"Special wine! First Pessac-Leognan ever tasted. Hopefully not the last... Absolutely charming terroir-driven nose. Pencil lead, crushed rocks, tar with cassis and black currants, sublime! Dry, full bodied, med- tannins, still rather firm tannins for a 24 year old. Palate, stunning! Following the nose with emphasized red fruits. Red currants, cherries, dried cranberries. Terroir is still there. Graphite, asphalt, tar... Long, long finish. Still tasting the tar in mouth. Price tag is heavy, that's why not 5*"
201,"Wonderful velvety wine. Great to drink woth friends or at a beautiful dinner. Tones of plum, dark fruit and leather. Still some tannins. Surely good to keep in the wine cellar for some more years as well."
202,"Roast duck breast today. Needs a good red and when you‚Äôre in Bordeaux never take St Julien with duck (everything gets more rusty (it does)). This 1998 Smith Haut Lafitte is a fine choice. Smells of pebbles and purple violets. It is a mix of Monday and Friday afternoons. Cassis fruit, pencil shavings, white pebbles, crushed rocks. Finely grained tannins give its finale texture. That combination is very Pessac Leognan."
203,"A fabulous treat at the chateau! Light rust color starting on edges. Been open a day so very smooth, a little hard to tell what is from the breathing and what is naturally aged. Either way, an excellent pour with cream br√ªl√©e on the nose. Body is mellowed soil, forest, but back to wood tones as well - cigar box, cedar closet, sawdust. Long luscious finish."
204,"Wow, amazing Plum, jam, blackberry on the nose, little vanilla and oak, leather Smooth on the palate, powerful and elegant at the same time, the flavors the nose picked up went straight the Piti the palate Just a lovely wine Love it at the moment, we have lots of Thai guests bringing their own wine and this is the level they bring.... and share a taster, I love it"
205,"One of the stars of the vintage, this elegant, smoky wine has hints of barbecue pit intermixed with sweet black currants and cherries. Dark purple and medium to full-bodied, its impressive finesse and wonderful purity make for a surprisingly forward style of Smith-Haut-Lafitte to drink over the next 15 or so years. R.P.92/100"
206,"Pop and pour, took more than one hour breathing in bottle to realize full potential, started with plum, black fruits, full, and rough on the edge, developed to be smooth, clean, elegant and pleasantly long finish. Drank neat, two hours after a Double Corona and no breakfast, imagine it might go well with a duck confit or lamb cutlet. Nice wine, ready to drink, won't be much better with further ageing but should stay good until 2020."
207,"Deep ruby colour. Very aromatic nose. Blackberry, plum, leather, vanilla, licorice, tobacco, pepper, basalmic. Med bodied, high tannin, dry, high acidity. Mild tannic finish. Still tannic and vibrant, can drink in more years. 4.3"
208,"Old world aromatic profile on the nose with cassis, blueberries, plums, lavender, licorice, tobacco, charcoal, and aromatic herbs . Still extremely tight on the palate, great tension in the wine with elegant dark fruit flavors that are balanced by just the right amount of acidity, torrefact notes on the midpalate that leave a moderate to long lasting finish where notes of charred greens, spices, minerals, and polished yet chewy tannins."
209,"4.5 is generous, the 4.3 average rating seems fair. However, at $60 it is excellent value. The wine has supple fruit, is well balanced, and the sweet tannins finish a long and round experience on the palate. Drinks very well. Certainly recommend."
210,"Mixed berries, cassis, oaky, peppers, dried plums on the nose, leathers and flowers. Hints of game. The flavour is quite exotic, of granite, herbs, black cherries, oak, leather. Very, very elegant, very stable. Hints of star anise, white peppers, cinnamon, Mandarin oranges, smoke, and truffle. The end is on a wonderful peak. I should say I'm blessed. I even have traces of mold on the cork. Not to mention that one random spike of burnt insect about a third of the way in..."
211,"Beautiful aroma of barnyard. Very youthful and forward with tannins and loads of fruit. The 55-35-10 blend is a great balance and the Cabernet Franc is delightfully present. Pomegranate, Cassis, leather and tar are present. Should be a 5 but after Aspen and the '53 Petrus I can't give way to grade inflation."
212,"Medium ruby, garnet on the rim, open up with pronounced aromas of tar, leather, farmyard, graphite, a bit herbs and black berries-plum after decanting... so elegant. On the palate perfect balance, acidity and tannins with smooth intense flavors of minerals, herbs and black fruit, super long finish. Drink now, this is at its best, what a great wine!"
213,"Deep ruby color with violet rim reflections. Expressive, intense and elegant notes of ripe black fruit like blueberry, blackberry, black cherry and lovely aromas of violet, eucalyptus and prunes mixed with tobacco leaves, cigar box and spices like cloves and cinnamon. Great structure and silky texture with firm tannins. Full bodied, balanced, good acidity and long possessive finish."
214,"This one will last a few decades from now and will get better with age. Right now it‚Äôs enjoyable but still closed on the palate and cloaked with high tannins and alcohol. Very seductive on the nose with notes of leather, cedar, damp earthy soil, and blueberries. Very nice bottle. 4.6"

While Honeyed Melon, mandarin orange, early ripe Maui Gold Pineapple are dazzling your jaded palate, the fulsome mouth fill and round tannins will help cut through any spicy Asian food or Heavy French sauce to give you instant gratification. Complexity is had with Fig, liquid orange rind and lemon zest dancing to buttery Yuzu notes. Am I fantasizing? Perhaps just a little. 95pts"
217,"Woooow always is nice to taste some wines like this one, about the wine what can I say knowing the region and about this specific wine, the only thing I really miss tasting this wine was my beautiful wife that's way I give to this wine 4.5 The best thing in my life always will be my wife, our family and of course our good friend Having them my life is perfect"
218,"There were three of us sitting at the table. We all took a sip....and went silent...do you dare speak when you‚Äôre face to face with the proof of the existence of God? Sublime! Silky velvet with layers of flavors, well alive and still (oh! so gently) kicking with the energy of a 23 year old sophisticated Lady..."
219,"Totally worth it! The first one to impress me today and I'm addicted! Dried fruits and if velvety tannins give you a hard-on, this is a satin slipping off a freshly waxed leg. So we'll integrated, such balance and sophisticated roundness"
220,"Smoky and vanilla nose. Elegantly subtly acidic. Lots of dark fruit, cassis. Thick smooth without being in your face. Medium tannic black tea at the middle towards the end. A little spice at the end too. Long oaky finish. OK, give it a 4.5 due to its great balance."
221,"Very Nice. Clearly a 4.5+ Delicious! Well made. Balanced. Citrus, peach, a touch of pear, green apple, and oak. This has a lot of life left. It can age. I don‚Äôt get much vanilla or tobacco. Very good."
222,"Not the best of vintages,but this one is still a killer Dark red color.Medium intensity nose with aromas of ripe cherries,licorice,figs,coffe,dried herbs and earthy tones.On the palate the purity and intensity of fruit it's amazing.There are also mineral flavours of graphite,damp earth.Ripe tannins,medium+ acidity and a medium+ finish.Very nice experience!"
223,"4.4+ First opened in the set. Runner up with amazing result! Swamp odor with plum notes. Very powerful, full-bodied and complex wine. The acidity is average. The taste of rawmaden leather, black plums and rotten cherries. Somee spicy notes. Long aftertaste. Awesome wine! And for such price is generally the best of its kind! Recommend! Cheers!"
224,"Pours an intense, deep garnet color. Exuberant aromas of fruitcake, cranberry, eucalyptus, crushed rocks. At 5 years old, this wine is like velvet; present yet elegant tannins. Boysenberry and cranberry forward, pencil lead mid, and a smoked eucalyptus finish. Dare I say this wine is in its prime? Enjoy now through the next couple of years. Hands down one of the best Bordeaux I have tried, and a must have for a Graves or Bordeaux lover."
225,"RP98+ This wine has laser-like definition in its an remarkable nose of a subtle charcoal fire interwoven with spring flowers, creme de cassis, blueberry liqueur and spicy wood. Full-bodied, stunningly concentrated, long, rich and moderately tannic, this wine is set for an exceptionally long life of 30-40 years but can be drunk in 5-7. By RP advocate"
226,"Seductive nose of Asian pear, licorice, plum, cream & oak. Dark ruby in color. Full bodied with nice acidity and super long finish. Feels like a jab, bait, pull & cross counter in my mouth haha. Multi layered."
227,We tried our first ever pessacs side by side - this and the domaine du chevalier 2014. This was the lighter wine but it had a depth and breadth of scents and flavours that was different with each glass - for me that is the sign of a great wine
228,"Friday lunch catch up with winos! 2009 bordeaux session that lasted 4 hrs with 4 great selections (1. Chateau Smith Haut Lafitte 2. Chateau Leoville poyferre 3. Chateau Malescot St. Exupery 4.

Boom beautiful & the most balance among all! 4.5pts ++ Easily last for another 10+ yrs P/S: I was too focus on eating, enjoying & by the time I wanted to write my notes, I was a bit drunk so can't goes into details."
229,Really impressed with with Sav blanc blend. 95% + Sav Blanc with a touch of Semillion for balance. A little bit of age and from a great producer. The price is really to high for this style but if you get a chance is well worth a taste.
230,"4,3 Blend of CS, Merlot, CF and PV (55/36/8/1) from Pessac-L√©ognan with 18m ageing in FO barrels (60% new). Med-deep cherry color, a bit hazy. Med-high intensity on the nose.

Vanilla, black fruit, mocha, splash of caramel, pipe tobacco, baking spice on finish. Moderate plus acidity, low end of high alcohol, medium plus body, lots of complexity, velvety smooth/lingering but high tannin. Great balance, fantastic bottle."
232,"2016 is still very young, almost too young to drink, yet it is nicely settled and enjoyable. Absolutely delivers what one can expect from that price range. Great concentration, deeply pigmented, lots of black fruits, charred wood, coffee. Very pleasant round and smooth tannins. This is going to be absolutely outstanding in some 10 years."
233,"I was expecting great things and was a little disappointed at first, but improved and improved after 2 hours of breathing. Mint, dark fruit and charcoal on the nose. Balance and structure. Cedar, blackberries, graphite and well-integrated tannins. Long finish."
234,Another amazing night-in with the Mackies. This wine is still a juvenile seductively showing subtle cassis aromas with tobacco and vanilla. Tannins integrated and flavours of blackberry and plum. Balanced but may show more as she ages?
235,"RP100 pointer.... licorice, cassis, blueberries on the palate.... powerful on the nose but medium bodied on the palate ... graphite, cedar, tobacco and black berry. Still can be kept 20 to 30 years ...."
236,"Still young and primary but already delicious. Intense nose, full of ripe and sharp fruit with a hint of tobacco. Powerful attack, concentrated and intense yet fresh and silky. Notes of ripe plum, blueberries, liquorice and mocha. Super long, 30+ second finish, clean but slightly sweet. Loved it."
237,"Ok, this could probably last another 20 years, but its already great. Deep black chocolate, pronounced tannins, very well balanced acid and body. Long and tannic finish, a bit of black cherry and cranberry."
238,"Decanted 90mins and drink over another 90mins. Dark crimson purple. Mixed of berries and currants, and hint of herbaceousness on the nose. Round and full-bodied with still rather youthful tannins, yet smooth on the palette. Structure of the wine is still evolving, perhaps at least 10 years or more to enjoy."
239,"Nice purple color; smoke, truffle, tobacco, chocolate and spring flowers which really get you going. Rich intense and concentrate, i enjoy this well balance sweet tannins full body. High alcohol and long finish."
240,"(93/100) (74.-) Time is enjoyment! Let this wie breathe and you'll find an elegant mix of fresh plum fruit, spices, nuts and a hint of leather. It gets denser and longer, is seductive and ends in a great and convincing finish!"
241,A superb French Grand Cru - purchased at a paired tasting on board the SS Regent Navigator while on holiday in the French Polynesian Islands - it‚Äôs is a very soft and well rounded full bodied red - an outstanding nose of floral and spring cherry blossom - soft on the palate and delicate with a bright deep cherry and vanilla forward
242,"What an incredibly bold Bordeaux white - I have never tasted anything like it. Amber colour with a rust tint. Incredible nose of sherry and white port wine, sweetness from dried apricots and dark toffee. Such great complexity in this Bordeaux white - Low acidity lending to its smoothness. Layers of spiced earth, more apricot, orange, honied nuts and cloves with a subtle woody frame. 4.25p"
243,"A Grand Vin. It already leaves sediment in the decanter, and it's changing constantly in the glass. Smooth ripe fruit, liquid graphite, paprika, chocolate make a complex nose. Really intense on the palate, velvety but assertive tannin, fleshy, long."
244,"Beautiful souvenir from Paris. Nose of crushed rose petals, tobacco and dark chocolate. Dark licorice, blackberry, currant, and cherrywood body. Just a bit of peppercorn and luscious tannins on the medium plus finish. Fuller bodied but balanced. Drinking wonderfully now but still a baby and will be great in 3-5 years. Pairs wonderfully with a bleu d'auvergne style cheese or grilled meat. Not a 20+ year keeper but will be a great seven to ten year old!"

At first the nose started not realy clear, probaly it needed more time to open up. After a while, she showed al her perfumes, with exotic fruits, a fine buttery undertone, acacia blossoms and smoky figs. The palate bursted with fruit, a growing pr√©sence of vanilla cream, but a great cut of acidity keeps it fresh and mineral. The finish is long,..üîõ 4.5üåü"
247,"Tasted at UGCB London event. 2y.o. Only rough notes. Color: Med+ ruby. Nose: Peppery and black fruits, black plum, blackcurrant, blueberry, balanced by ample crushed gravel, minerals, cedar, star anise, and white pepper. Palate: Reflects the nose, black fruits balanced by spices--white pepper, star anise--with abundant minerals, graphite, and ends again in a long pepper finish. High acidity, full bodied, with high amounts of softer tannins. Excellent and very approachable now. Exceptional effort. 92 points."
248,"At the UGCB 2017 tasting in Chicago Jan 22nd. A Grand Cru Classe Graves.   Balanced oak and dark fruit, hints of blueberry and savory. Very nice medium tannins. With a medium length dry finish.

249,"3rd wine on Beirut - Doha trip, to be paired with cheese. La grande classe! Explosion of black berries, red fruits, cranberry, licorice, leather, plum and more! Perfect acidity. Looong languorous finish, am in love!"
250,"Deep ruby with tons of dark fruit, a hint of pepper, vanilla and caramel. Med+ acidity and mid to full bodied with tons of fruit, firm and gripping tannins and long mouthfeel. Lots of potential for aging, lots of room for tannin integration."
251,"Did I tell you Graves is da bomba of 2017 Bordeaux vintage? Oh, yes I did and please excuse me sounding like a broken record, urr, people under the age of 25, please google ‚Äúturntable‚Äù and ‚Äúvinyl‚Äù; garnet burgundy color, another mineral laden, mouth smacking tasty wine, more fruit driven than others on the nose with hibiscus, cassis, blueberry, licorice, clove, nutmeg, hazelnut and cacao, full body with balanced acidity and velvety tannin that firms up after airing long and elegant finish, mineral driven."
252,"Classic Bordeaux profile. Earthy and dark canopy floor to the senses. Fig, blackberries and cassis. Intense mid palate finish. Although a 2006, this puppy can sleep for another 5-7 years before being disturbed. Nice"
253,"Earth and Apple. Perfect balance. Made from 17 plus years old vines. 90 % SB, 5 % SG and 5% Semillion. A deep golden color. Has a roundness to it but with the bright beginning of a SB. Great year, hot summer. Lots of fruit and concentration."
254,"First planted in 1365. Quality has improved since 2000. Own cooperage makes 70% of their barrels. Satellite used to optimise time to harvest 140 parcels on 78ha. Use optical sorters.Average vine age 65 years. Intensifying from 7.5k to 9k vines per ha. 2017 yield was 40% of normal. Blend 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 35% Merlot, 4% Cabernet Frank, 1% Petit Verdot. PH 3.7, alc 13.5% Purple, thick legs and Christmas cake (red currant) aroma. Taste of black currant, blackberry, cassis, oak and vanilla. üá´üá∑üç∑üòã"
255,"Very powerful rich wine with full body, velvety tone. Would associate this wine with power and presence of a 18 wheeler Mack truck. Goes well with flavorful dishes such as Beijing duck, plum sweet and sour pork."
256,"A truly classic wine-Dark ruby red with slivers & a hue of garnet on its lip. limpid & interminable legs & tears. Nose- plenty of jammy black berries, liquorice, violets, a hint of leather & fine noble woods. In mouth-Dry, warm, tannic, robust, confirmation of the jams & liquorice, hints of aged leather & fine cigarbox woods. Ready to drink now but it will age even better in the next 10 years. Balanced & harmonious. Interminable finish. To be paired with game meat, Spanish ham & a PdH Comendador 20-20 Toro!"
257,"Gorgeous color. Purple, inky opalescence. Elegant aromas of cedar, Sandalwood, and milk chocolate. The mouthfeel is perfect. Moderate to heavy viscosity floats into chocolate notes, berry pie filling, and cigar box. Balanced and lingering AT. Would have been a 5 except we drank Eifrig 09 against it."
258,"Gorgeous wine, meaty with plenty of tannins. Naturally, this wine should be cellared more, but the taste of blackberry compote, blueberry, graphite, anise, black currant liqueur, cassis, spice, and licorice is stunning."
259,"It doesn't get much better if you like fruity, silky smooth but not over powering Bordeaux. The high % of Merlot brings softness and lightness to this wine. The nose was awesome from the start. The smoke, leathery, aromas for that distinctly Bordeaux nose."
260,A really superb bottle of claret from a great vintage. Lovely richness with a touch of prunes on the palate. Fleshy and warm. Ripe and plump but full of smoothness and charm. Silky and voluptuous. Great find FarQ!
261,"Just great üëç Nose still very young, huge berries, vanilla, lightly toasted oak, dry herbs, spices. Gorgeous palate, all mellow, very fresh with superb tanins. Spicy peppery finale. What a superb vintage !"
262,"Wow. Unmistakably Graves with impeccable balance, structure, sweetness, acidity, minerality and length. An extraordinary wine made with extraordinary skill, '10 SHL showed with immense concentration of blackberry jam, peppercorn and cedar, with gobs of gorgeous acidity to keep things fresh with plenty of lift. Tannins are fine and the finish is long, full of scorched earth and incense. So complex, with waves of flavors, this is a SERIOUS wine, worthy of any accolades it receives. Drink 2020-2040+!"
263,"Evidently an excellent vintage for this house. Needed a couple of hours to show it‚Äôs mettle. Robust mouthfeel, black forest fruit backbone with all the tertiary nuances - tobacco, leather, oak, hints of vanilla and a wisp of smoke and tar, complemented by soft silky tannins on the eternal finish"
264,"QUICKIE: Coming into it's window according to the rags. Blueberry, chicory, smoked meat, hint of black cherry and purple flowers - lots of complexity on the nose. On the palate, silky entry mirrors the nose, a touch of acidity comes on mid-palate to call you to attention for a hot second then fades into a smooth M+ finish. Clear that this wine has a lot more runway, but a privilege to experience it now!"
265,"17.5/20 nose: very smoked, savory barbecued fruit, vanilla and spices. palate: (blew me away in comparison with the smell) very dense, elegant sandy tannins, black olives, mouth filling with blackcurrant, complex palate with a very long finish."
266,JS Bordeaux 2020 En Primeur tasting. Making a note for the ones that I liked to try later when it gets released. Dry and hot weather. Power and balance all together. Ripe fruits with concentration. Round and ripe. Best score given by JS(99-100!)
267,A 100 Parker point wine. For now it is extremely youthful to me and would benifit from several years of cellaring. Hints of black fruit and yoghurt on the nose. The fruit is present on the palate as well along with a crisp acidity and heavy tannins. 95 points but imagine it can keep for ages and evolve.
268,"20 years ago, I had a chance to taste this win in the big company party in the Shilla hotel. Love for this wine started from that time. One of my standard at those days, I could tale chance more gorgeous wine after."
269,"In the beginning it is closed on the nose and on the toungue but after an hour in the glass it shows high quality, a bit harsh tannins, a great bouquet and taste. Blackcurrants, blackberries, stable, earth and autumnleaves. Powerful, fullbodied, longlasting."
270,"One of the rare domain in Bordeaux producing excellent white and red wine. 05 is amazing now, full power on black currant, with leather, sweet spices... rich and full bodied with med+ ripe / velvety tannins. üëçüëçüëç"
271,Have own coperage Average vine age 65 years - high use of modern technology - no using organic principles and looking at biodynamics 60-70% new french oak 18 months only 40% of normal production - badly frost impacted Deep ruby still a but closed muted dark fruit on the noise refined elegant tannins density and completeness without heaviness. Stunning & balance completeness. 5 Stars
272,"Big Star (Jayhawks) Big Bordeaux! This smooth and polished red was a fantastic mix of acidity, sweet fruit (clearly apricots), spicy dark berry, smoke, earth, tobacco and dusty tannins. It has a classic density, a remarkable freshness and good length resulting in an uplifting drinkability from start to finish. This ripe and delicious wine developed rather fast in the glass and gave me more dark fruits by the minute. And a constantly long oaky finish. Yes, it ‚ÄòLa-fitted‚Äô me quite well!"
273,"Great nose with big cassis fruit, cedar, coffee, cinnamon, vanilla, full bodied on the palate with layers of ripe sweet black berries, licorice, silky tannin and good acidity, long aftertaste, delicious wine 97 DSP"
274,"On the nose it burst of blackberry , hint of pepper, orange peel ,palate wise it‚Äôs rich and velvety , finishing wise its dry with strong tannin. it‚Äôs still a very young wine so decanting is a must."
275,"Drank this far too young so ultimately reserving judgement. Still tannic and full bodied, but with good acidity and great aging potential. Leave in cellar for another decade then revisit!"
276,"Didn't need a lot of decanting..typical Bordeaux. Hints of leather, ripe black fruit. Still very fruity taste. Medium build. It's starting to show its age ..which is lovely!"
277,"Got that one on Qatar Airways. It is common to say that taste is affected by altitude on a plane but my palate was sharp enough to appreciate this wine! Smoky, full-bodied."
278,"98+ Ripe, dense and concentrated red and blue fruit, with bright acidity and a savory accent to the grippy (and seriously mouth-coating) tannins. This has major structure and needs time, but is already beautiful. Consumed over 4 days, with consistent results."
279,"Very good, fresh (even after 22 years), fruity, with some evident strawberries, bell pepper and black pepper, good but mellow tannins, great match for a delicious BBQ picanha. Second wine from Francisco Altimari stash of 1998 Bordeaux, finally drinking them to celebrate Fran‚Äôs birth."
280,"Inky dark rich ruby red in colour. Nose somewhat tarish and smoky. Intense, big wine although middle palate needs time to soften as tannin is quite strong and also quite acidic. One imagines a more approachable, smooth wine in 5 years or so."
281,"This wine will last and last... such ripe, grippy tannins and balanced elements on the palate: acid, fruit, oak all in harmony. Maybe drinking this prematurely. Showing incredible potential. Ripe juicy mulberry fruit, cigar box and saddle leather and dried mint to top it off. Keep."
282,A bit to hard character and tannins are hard and unbalanced profile - not a big success this vintage - lets see how it will go with a few years of aging
283,"Enjoyed at Bouchon with Jai and Mauricette. Excellent pairing with Mussels and Dorado. Apr 26,2021. Pre Swiss tripüòä"
284,Red fruit underneath a little green herbal component. Still got some grip which surprised. Bit special.
285,"Tasted in a visit to Chateau . Black fruits, smoked, flintstones area. Very Good. 2009 too expensive"
286,"Prime time. A little smoke, a lot of very tasty. From appearance to nose to palate, this is right near maximum score."
287,"Great 10yr old Bordeaux. Lovely stuff, very classic, blackberries, oak, needs to open a couple of minutes. Beauty..love it."
288,"Concentrated dark fruit, blackberry, dark currant, plum, earth, soy, floral. Medium body. Beautiful fruit on the palate with refined tannins"
289,Very well balanced wine even at this vintage. Opens up well. Lots of blackberry tobacco oak vanilla
290,"Black fruit, vegetal notes, cedar, cigar box, fine tannin, great concentration, balance and good length... serious wine"
291,"Dark burgundy red. Dark berry fruit, some spice. Rich full palate with smooth fine tannins and great potential."
292,"Everything you would expect from such a fine vintage ... a joy to experience, wonderful depth and power"
293,Voila.. Once a while you came across a decent and good wine - and this is definitely one of them. Smooth and easy.
294,"Beautiful wine. Dense and rich. Blackberries, leather, spice. Stunning in the glass. Loved this"
295,"Plenty of dark fruit, flavors from the oak barrels and loads of tannins. Gosh - in 15 years this will be a stunning wine."
296,"Beautifully matured, soft and still fruity, but full-bodied, and nicely structured bordeaux! A pleasure to enjoy!"
297,"Earthy, green vegetal notes combine with dried fruit characters like prune, raisin, blackcurrant and licorice."
298,"It gets better with every sip. Perfumy, smooth and easy to drink after a couple of hours of decanting. Brilliant!"
299,N: pungent seductive nose sweet vanilla and dried pineapple P: tropical fruit evolved into grape fruit Delicious!
