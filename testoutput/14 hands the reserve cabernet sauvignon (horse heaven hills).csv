0,"I was surprised to see reviews haven‚Äôt favored this one. I had different, much longer thoughts. Read them here: https://wp.me/p3eK7o-2nS Cheers!"
1,"This is no Hot to Trot Blend! Most people associate 14 Hands Winery with their big production, user friendly red blends like Hot to Trot. But visiting the winery in Prosser, WA gives one a completely different view of their wines. Available rarely outside of the tasting room or to club members, 14 Hands Reserve wines are to be sought out for quality and value. Earthy with cassis, red berries, licorice and oh so smooth. Long finish. 4.2/5 stars."
2,"Another solid 14 Hands Reserve! This WA CS is masculine, bold, and still very young. Decanted 2hrs. Opaque violet with narrow rim. Pleasant aromatics start with deep floral mixed with herbaceous notes and leathery tertiary notes in the background. Spicy full bodied chalky mouthfeel with young edgy acidity. Chalky red to blue fruit with tobacco lingering in the finish. Love the QPR of these bottles..."
3,"Paid $10.99 from $13.99,so good at that price! Wouldn't pay full price for it, but it was pretty hearty and smooth. We liked it."
4,"Good dark fruit flavours, backed by soft tannins, with oak playing a prominent part."
5,Very clear variety... in smell and taste... cigar box... very full! quite wild... as usual in the new world... for wild wine lovers... very nice and good to drink.
6,Decent everyday cab that is medium bodied and average acidity with basic tannins that emerge and fade quickly.
7,"Intensely dark color. The aroma is strong with notes of cassis and fresh cedar. Added blueberry to the nose. Palate is medium tannin, long acidic finish with added notes of raspberry and mint."
8,"Fruity, bold, easy to drink, whenever I buy this, people always like it!"
9,So yummy and full bodied!
10,"Excepcional CS do Columbia Valley, em Washington. Superou muito a expectativa. Aroma muito intenso, com compotas, h√∫mus e tabaco. Paladar bem encorpado, concentrado, com taninos macios e bem equilibrado. Custo x beneficio muito interessante."
11,"Good cab for the price, nose of kitchen spices and hints of vanilla, ruby body of black currents, finish with smooth tannins and hints of oak."
12,"Very light body for a cab. Cherry, raspberry and strawberry. Modest tannins show in a short finish. Not bad for the price."
13,"Visited the winery today and the Reserve wines are definitely affordable, QPR. Thanks Chad!üëçüèª Paired this Cab with a great burger and fries in downtown Walla Walla. 3.7 stars for this too young wine with more aging potential. I don‚Äôt know why Vivino rate this wine with 3.1 stars. A deep ruby red with many long legs. Medium intense nose of blackberries, black cherries, tobacco, cedar, spices, some forest floor and toast. The red has a medium acidity, medium velvety but still a bit chewy tannins. ~~~~>>"
14,"Black cherry, baking spice, stone fruit"
15,Deep purple blackberry black currant and dark chocolate. Full body present tannins and long finish.
16,"Smooth, a little sweet, dark cherry"
17,A nice surprise. Fruit forward. Picking up blackberry and dark cherry. Tannins at mid palette. Smooth finish. Perfect for springtime
18,"Easy drinking, solid cab, pairs well with food or on its own"
19,"Amazing Cabernet. Excellent acidity, long lasting, wood, body. It was a great partner for dinner."
20,Great cab for the money. Would definitely recommend.
21,"Well balanced, full bodied. Not very complex but a solid cab with a steak or spicy meal"
22,This Reserve Cab from 14 Hands is very good. Smooth on the tongue with dry mild finish.
23,"Super thick and syrupy but actually pretty good, had in NYC at Frances Tavern. Sweet!"
24,"Fruity, mild taste. Very good with steaks"
25,Great value. Full body. No bite
26,"A little too sweet, but it has a nice body and a little spice to it. Un poco dulce, pero buen cuerpo y con un dejo especiado."
27,Dark cherry and great with steak. Kim visited this winery this past month in WA.
28,"Smooth and balanced on the palate. Not too much fruit but not dry at all. So smooth and easy, you almost forget you're drinking it, yet you have a big smile on your face at the end!"
29,"Really good, easy drinker, great price point!"
30,"A rich, beautifully-colored cab with a nice nose. Good legs, starts with blackberry, cherry amidst low tannins, followed by some chocolate with a wonderful aftertaste. Who knew Washington state could produce such a wine? Evocative of some New Zealand reds I've had."
31,"Having delicious burgers at the red monkey in Walla Walla paired with that 14 hands Reserve Cab! 3.5‚≠êÔ∏è for a good value but not very complex! Deep ruby color. On the nose are aromas of blackberries, black cherries, tobacco, cedar, spices, toast and forest floor. The dry red has a medium acidity and medium, velvety tannins. On the palate are flavours of blackberries, cherries, tobacco, earth, tar, spices and cedar. A long finish! Cheers üç∑"
32,"For the everyday drinking Cab, nice for the price. You won't be embarrassed if you bring this one to a party. Better than average for the price but an obvious step down from a $30+ bottle."
33,"Light in color. Fruit and spice one the nose, thought subtle. Young fruit on the palate."
34,Black cherry with a hint of licorice and spice- excellent on its own but better with food.
35,"Heavy oak, plum. Full bodied, tannin 7/10. Lower acid"
36,"Dark inky Color. Nose of hotness, white pepper and cherries with underlying ripe cheese. Nice Sofy texture on this wine, notes of ripe cherries and plump fruit. Typical American cab flavor. Med finish."
37,A light Washington cab in the old world style. Eucalyptus and brown spice without being overbearing. Approachable to the Cabernet novice yet cab veterans will appreciate it's Bordeaux like qualities.
38,Smooth with some sweetness (for a Cab). Can hold its own paired with food but also delicious alone. Decant it to let it evolve - it gains depth. Great value!
