12,"It doesn't thrill, but it's made with care and love, so in the end I'm satisfied. I could say more or less the same for all the gr√ºner veltliners I've tasted in my life, so I think it's my final opinion about this grape. It displays green apple, pear, grapefruit and hints of mango, balanced with delicate herbal notes. On the palate it's medium-bodied, easy and aromatic, with a fine fresh finish. Pretty. A thing I didn't know: DW is a coop whose members own 30% of the vineyard area in the Wachau region."
13,"This is my first Gruner Veltliner Nice, cute, drunk at a restaurant in Wagrain, Austria 3.6 euro for a glass. In Israeli terms this is high VFM but in Austrian terms I don‚Äôt know... taxs and wine shops margins are big in Israel"
14,Pleasurable day time deck companion for that weekend drizzle. Wet stone in the nose. Restrained pale summer fruits on the palate. A light bite and hints of honey in the hinterlands. At ease with the more eloquent poolside snack. 3.7

32,Solid! Apple and Pepper! :-)
33,"Tasted during WSET LV 3 07.09.2020 Appearance is clear, lemon gold. Nose has a medium intensity, wine is still developing. Lemon and red apple are the primary in the nose, some stone fruits as well, peach and apricot mostly. Hints of cheese in the nose.

A medium golden colored wine with medium + intense nose with banana, melon, elderflower, resin, apricots and blossom. On the palate not surprisingly a rich experience with melons, apricots, yoghurt, herbal tones, yet very harmonious! In addition it has a nice glycerine/oily mouthfeel, Refreshing medium acidity and a medium (+) length. A very good wine that has some ageing potential as well!"
50,"Very intense flowery nose, maybe jasmin. With time, nose becomes earthy. On tge palate, mineral and citrusy (acidity develops with time)"

89,"Very aromatic with perceptible notes of lime and lemon but also grapefruit and floral. In mouth refreshing acidity and soft, mineral bitterness followed by pleasant citrus notes. Good experience."

100,"Fruits from single vineyard Kaiserberg, where Charlemagne set a camp duringhis reign. Nice texture and acidity supplemented with rich floral and yellow stonefruits aromas."
101,"#alittlesipofwine Aromas of vanilla, lemon curd, minerals & orange rind. Dry, high acidity, medium minus alcohol & body. Flavour characteristics of dried apricot, spice, lime & a tart finish. Yum."

104,"Lime, lemon, peach and a good lick of spicy white pepper. Leaning toward oily texture on the palate, but has enough acidity to balance that. Overall, decent session white with texture! 3.6"
105,"Tried and true GV, inexpensive and always packing a big punch. Fruit forward white with lots of tropical fruit and citrus with tons of minerality and a heavier body, flat out a great food wine. 3.7"
106,For us gooseberry dominates this wine and a bit of freshly cut apple slices plays along. it is fantastic as a cool wine on a hot summer Day sitting on the porch.
107,"Exquisite, Gr√ºner Veltliner with a very bright yellow color. Refreshing wine, very fresh, lively, with intense fruit and mineral acidic character. Aromas of citrus, fruit bright sour, lemon, lemonka, fresh pineapple."
108,"Everything you expect from a great GV. Sharp lemon, green apple and kiwi acidity. Crisp minerality and salinity. Peppery bite finishes it off. Soft background of peach and pear, but they are truly distant to the citrus acidity...which suits me just fine."
109,"Well-known producer, it should be good gruner, but it smells like Riesling, domaine wachau also have Riesling. Maybe this bottle has wrong label. Medium/light acidity, medium body, medium/long aftertaste. Rubber, petroleum, green apple, grass, minerals."
110,"My first Gruner Veltliner, but a great recommendation from my friend Kyle. A lower price point than the Gewurztraminer by the same label, but equally less sweet, more Sauvignon-esque, with nice notes of pear, green apple, and really just a great summer drinker. Will buy again."
111,"Great to start that ultimate dinner that you sometimes need to cook for your girlfriend (or family, or friends, or whatever). Little sparkly spark (wonderland) to get that party started. Smooth, elegant, pleasure! Good value for money (around 11‚Ç¨). Dont drink this while driving!"
112,"Starting with minerality, grapefruit, apple,green ball pepper and opening up into honey, white flesh peach, white flowers and white pepper in the nose, medium plus body, medium plus acidity, minerality, citrus, apple and pear on the palate, medium plus finish. Balanced with nice minerality and decent ageing potential - also good value for money."
113,"My favorite winery in Austria! A lovely place to visit with wonderful people and wonderful wines. Austria is a glorious place with wonderful souls that are proud of their wines and their heritage. This GV presents with yellow-green color and very patient thick, long tears. Nose of herbs, yeast and lemongrass. Opening of green apples, lemon/lime, old sneaker soles and chalk. Light-plus bodied and medium-plus acidity with a bold, earthy and long finish. üòã Peace and cheers!"
114,"Fresh and very delightful. Citrus, grass, and floral perfume on the nose. Dry, medium light and balanced acidity. Lemon and yellow grapefruit palate on apple and pear with a minerals toned finish. Hints of white pepper and licorice."
115,"Amazingly fresh for a 2017 now. A pretty, petite wine. Light, crystal coloration. Bouquet & flavors of lemons & Cape-gooseberry (ground cherry). Small, compact, & in a lighter style‚Äîbut delicious. Quite acidic, yet rich. Went both with wiener schnitzel on Day 1 & then with mediterranean chicken skewers on Day 2. Saw some of their vines when touring, but didn‚Äôt stop. Should have. Almost a rebuy. 4.0 woofs."
116,"Pale yellow in color, medium plus acid, 12% alcohol beautiful structure. Opens with lemon, pear, honey blossom,limestone, followed by lemon peel, green apple, Bartlett pear, honey, thyme, salty minerals, and finishes with a creamy mouthfeel, balanced acidity, citrus, and herbs. Wonderful on this 100 degree day in central California!"
117,"üëÄ: Pale lemon. üëÉüèª: Medium intensity of complex aromas: grass, wax, white peach, pomelo, pear. Youthful. üëÖ: Dry with medium plus acidity, alcohol and light body. Medium intensity of complex flavours: grass, pepper, lemon, grass and savory. Medium length. Drink now and not suitable for aging."
118,"Excellent Gruner Veltliner! The color is almost water like with shades of green / gold. The nose has the signature wet stone scent and citrus. The acidity is medium, but the wine still has a clean mouthfeel. This one is a pleasure to drink!"
119,"Distinctive nose of apricot and grapemust. Its refreshing palate encompasses a short maracuja attack followed by gradually emerging grapefruit that lingers until the liquid part of the wine entirely evaporates giving ground slowly to grape aromas, presumably stemming from the dry matter content. Mediocre centre surrounded by amazing start and finish. (8.5 pts)"
120,Well....after tasting raw grouper ceviche. ..time has come to taste it cook. ...gr√ºner veltliner premier grape from Austria ..it is the third time I am enjoying this wine the more I do the more I like ....cheers my friends! !!!
121,"Color: Clear straw Smell: Apples, dates, sake, and a bit of the muskiness of a sauternes. Taste: Honeydew melon, minerals, bit of apple, chalk, bit of acid on the end. Good, balanced. My Rating: 90."
122,"Like a Hitler watercolour, this wine lacks a little heart and empathy. It is easy on the palate though. citrus green apple and a touch of lemon matched by crisp acidity does make for an enjoyable wine but just lacking in depth."
123,"91/100. pale straw color. aroma of fresh green apple, apricot, and white peach at cooler temperature. moved to lemon gradually. in palate, spicy notes of pepper & flint minerality were more remarkable than fruity aroma. M-H acidity with refreshing character. medium to light body(12.5%). alcohol was not notable. dry. very high cost-value. pairing with fried chicken was so good. Japanese tonkatsu or ricotta cheese salads were also fine to be paired with. Jamon was not that good."
124,"A plus .5 for being a spicy, white wine, I was not expecting that. Citrus, green apple, for the open with a middle of lemon and then grapefruit, some herbs and spice on the lasting finish. I actually like it! I can see this being a good social wine, a pleasant surprise for your guests. The ever so slight, light green hue should raise a few brows. 12.5% alc. helps keep things friendly. I didn‚Äôt chill it and not sure that you need to, someone add to this and let me know for next time."
125,"3.8‚≠êüëå Very nice light Gruner Veltliner! M body, light almost transparent hay colour. Bouquet full of floral and grass notes, peach, pear, quince. Palate: citrus, green apple, lots of minerals and nice strong acidity. Great choice for pairing with sea food üëç"
126,"Clean clear wine with a green golden core and pronounced narrow watery rim. Nose of tropical citrus lime and peach with undertones of rubber ball. Wine is dry, medium acidity with a robust structure and good length. Smooth finish but must be served chilled. Great with seafood."
127,"100% gruner from Austria. 12.5% alcohol. Very light yellow body with slight fizz. üëÉ: apple, some petrol (very faint). Develops in the glass and is dominated by wild flowers after a few minutes. üëÑ: minerals, flowers, apple. Great wine! 3.9"
128,"This has a lovely, slightly oily, medium bodied character, floral white flowers on the nose, a hint of lime, lemon zest, palate is green apple lemon, lime & a hint of elderflower. Long finish. Great value!"
129,"4.0 ‚≠êÔ∏è Very nice Gr√ºner Veltliner. Medium yellow in glass. The nose is attractive and flowery with hints of water lily, lime, jasmine, alpine meadow, green pepper, frost. Light bodied, dry, high acidity, a bit oily texture. The taste is light and refreshing with hints of green pepper, lime, sage, thyme, lemon. The aftertaste is sour with a herbal note. Overall, a classic Gr√ºner Veltliner - light, undemanding, with some vegetable notes, and suitable for a great variety of dishes."
130,"Appearance: lemon-green, clear, medium intens. Nose: youthfull, medium intens, clean condition. Aromas of green apple, quince, elderflower, peach, lemon. Palate: dry, medium intens, medium+ acidity, medium - body, medium alcohol, medium finish of gooseberry. Added aromas to nose of white pepper, Pear, biscuit (sur lie) and grapefruit. Assessment: very good wine, drink now, no potential for aging."
131,"A gr√ºner that grows on me. Lots and lots of white pepper, followed by pear, orange and stone. Lovely spice and lots of fresh fruit. Lots of power yet fresh and vibrant. Loong salty and appely finish. Brilliant! 92p"
132,"1st Gr√ºner. Definitely not my last. Lovely crisp fruit like green apple on the nose followed by honeysuckle and hay. Palate is complex with flavors of pear, flint, grass, and key lime pie. 12.5 ABV is perfect of Apps. üëç"
133,"Pale straw color. On the nose: Yellow apple, lime, crushed rock, asparagus, and white pepper. On the palate: lime, slate. Quick finish. Mouth watering acidity. Would pair well with sesame chicken or fried flounder."
134,"The perk of being in Vienna on a Monday night for work: enjoying a top Gr√ºner with a stunning view of the cathedral. Domaine Wachau has a deservedly strong reputation (I enjoyed their Riesling earlier this year). Federspiel‚Äô relates to a lighter style of GV, lower in residual sugar and acidity than other comparable wines. This wine had a lovely herbaceous nose with hints of green apple peel. On the palate, there was restrained delicacy and a certain richness with Galia melon lingering at the end. 3.7"
135,"Gr√ºner Vetliner isnt something you come across often in Australia. I guess you could think of an dry Riesling cross crisp sauv blanc. I had this with some big aussie tiger prawns and it was a magical pairing. Very crisp, slight tingle on a short to medium length finish. Very subtle spice, zesty citrusy blend and a tiny hint of honey."
136,"Pale straw/yellow colour, watery. Strong minerality on the nose, citrus and white flesh fruit, and a herbal/leafy hint. Good intensity, quite pleasant. The palate is nice and juicy, the citrus and the pronounced acidity give a beautiful freshness but there is a richer scent perhaps of white peach. The finish is lingering and it delivers soft spices, such as nutmeg, anise, cardamom. A slightly off dry, med body with an intriguing complexity. 4-"
137,"Very nice. Clear, slightly green colour. White melon and nectarine on the nose. Very crisp and fruity palate with white melon and and quite pronounced white peppar. Long finish. My kinda wine. Half a star for price"
138,"First Austrian white for me, & first Gruner. Smells of blossom, ripe stone fruit, honey, and subtle spice. I expected some slight sweetness based off the aroma, but its bone dry with flavours of citrus, apricots, & some spiciness. Mid acid, mid alcohol and mid body. Bin clearance @ $16. 3.9"
139,"Federspiel designates this as being the middle of 3 qualitative tiers based on natural alcohol strength (11.5% - 12.5%). A year of late harvest with botrytis evident, though this wine avoids any sense of heaviness or hot Alc. Notes of green apple, cut clover, white asparagus (not as pungent), fresh creamy almond, wet stone -and saline fresh mineral lift. Interesting musk notes. Medium bodied, nice weight and if anything just a touch short on the finish. Screwcap 12.5%. Good with a lamb korma."
140,"My kind of white, very drinkable, balanced, delicious, subtle, and elegant. On the nose: lemon curd, lemon skins, pineapple juice, hint of saline/minerality, hints of green vegetables, white peppers, marzepan. Slightly bitter lemon skins, then perfect acidity, key lime pie, minerality, ending with white pepper. Subtlety and elegance you expect from this region."
141,"Finally trying a Gruner Veltliner, and we‚Äôre quite pleased! Dry and crisp with ripe apple up front and fair acidity and minerality towards the finish. Lime notes seem to drive the acidity, but they‚Äôre not as pronounced as in Sauv Blancs, and the Gruner instead has floral and light herbal elements to round out the flavor. Nice on its own and great with Julia‚Äôs chicken tikka masala and naan. Not sure how this compares to its peers, but it offers a great first impression of the varietal. 12.5% abv. 2.9.18"
142,"Straw wine growing rapidly addictive, mineral bouquet with dominant notes of gooseberry, herbs and white pepper. in the nose and on the palate can feel a little honey sweets - and I think that's why this is so Gr√ºner Veltliner balanced."
143,"Light yellow color. Granny Smith apple, kiwi, gooseberry with peach emerging with airing. Hint of jasmine. Apple and citrus to the taste with and almost ash like finish. Exhibited a refined complexity and was great value for money. Went well with a Reblochon cheese. Might go well with fish or salad."
144,"3.8‚≠ê Floral, spicy, minerality, peach and pear - what a nose Light grapefruit, flint and spice, light medium acidic finish. Beautiful grape, wonderful wine. We need to find more of the style to try. Happy long weekend all."
145,"Appearance: Intense lemon fading out to transparency. Nose: This bouquet continued to develop complexity after every glass! Almonds and dried apricots at the forefront followed by the perfume of frangipani. As the wine opened up slightly aged characters of toasted oak, slight kerosene and limestone began to emerge. Palate: Grapefruit zest and pineapple kick this palate off with white pepper tingling the tongue throughout beautiful length and an almost volcanic acidity."
146,"Classy Gruner veltliner from Wachau. Shiny pale gold on eye. Aromas of cut grass, lemon, yellow plum, melon, peach, honeysuckle, honey and white flowers. Elegant and well ballanced on the palate, great acidity and minerality. Pleasent long lasting finish. My score is 4.1"
147,"Solid Austrian white! Excellent with bream and caper dish. - visually- pale yellow - nose- some floral elements, honey and citrus, green apple and pear. - palate- good tang of acidity, minerals and good balanced richness."
148,"Medium golden yellow colour. Bouquet of passion fruit, melon, Granny Smith apple, and slight hint of organic solvent. Dry and somewhat buttery palate of melon, golden delicious apple, and lemon with high minerality and medium high acidity. Long finish of tropical fruit followed by apricot and tart notes of citrus. Medium bodied with negligible tannins. Moderate price and good value."
149,"3.9 Pale lemon-green color. The wine is youthful. A little restrained on the nose but opens up on the palate. Flavours of lemon, nectarine, green bell pepper, white pepper, wet stone, grass. High acidity, textural wine with med body and a med+ finish"
150,"Clear and medium intense golden yellow. On the nose, lemon, apples, yellow plum and some herbals, completed by green pear and melon as well as white pepper. The body is of medium plus volume and the acidity is good integrated. The wine is off-dry. Well-made GV for every day. (85 P)"
151,"4.0 Serious gr√ºner converts since our Danube tour, this brings all the memories of sunny Wachau Valley flooding back. Quintessential gr√ºner... zesty nose, slightly creamy on the palate, acid in control and freshness. Yum."
152,"WSET 3, week 4 Pale lemon. M. intensity. Lemon, green apple, yellow grapefruit, green pear, touch of peach, honeysuckle, wet stone. Youthful. Dry, h. acidity, m. alc, m. body. M. intensity. Slightly waxy mouthfeel w. good minerality. A little creamy too (lees?). Lacks typical varietal character of wh. pepper unfortunately. M(+) finish. Drink now. 3.5 12.5% alc, screwcap."
153,"Food friendly and similar to some Greek wines I have had. Calcareous earth scents and slight honeydew on the nose. Good acidity with a viscous mouth feel and flavors of persimmon, cantaloupe and a residual lemon mouth pucker."
154,"Federspiel is the middle grade of the Wachau classification system, above Steinfeder and below Smaragd. This example from the excellent Domane Wachau is a typical 12.5% ABV. Pale lemon-green. Medium intensity nose, quite ripe, herbaceous and citrus. Grapefruit, lemon, orange, green capsicum, bayleaf, apricot. The palate is dry and mineral, green and herbaceous. Lemon and orange fruit, white pepper spice. No MLF, with a medium finish and high acidity. Tasty, well-priced GruVe."
155,"3,4üåü This pleasant Gr√ºner Veltliner has aromas of pear, green apple and a herbal note. Palate is light, dry, sour and clean with green pear, zesty lemon, lots of crispy acidity and a spicy herbal note. Nicely balanced with a pleasant finish."
156,"Decent entry level GV. Would make for a nice drop on a hot day given the potent acidity. Palate is moderately clean with good fruit expression. Mostly neutral fruit along with some tangy citrus with just a hint of petrol, which could‚Äôve confuse me for a Riesling on the right day. Not a bad drop."
157,"Pale straw colour with a green hue. Youthful and fresh nose with grassy, floral and herbal notes. Fresh apple and pear on the palate, medium weight with a youthful acidity, and a peppery and herbal finish, fresh and digest."
158,"69/100 good Floral as lilly flower, lemon blossom, lemon, green apple quite simple Med minus body High acidity Med alcohol Med intensity Med finish The wine has nice parfume of a bouquet of flower but nothing muvh more lacking of complexity. Concentration and finish is on average. Good wine but I expected something more"
159,This is an intriguing wine. It starts out mildly sweet and then goes savory with minerality. I bought this at a tasting because it made me pay attention and think. It is relatively light; I had it alongside cheese and crackers last night and with chicken tortellini soup tonight. Both worked just fine. Tomorrow maybe with salad? Definitely a buy again.
160,My introduction to the Gr√ºner Veltliner. Green apple with a hint of ripe fruit and spices. Very well balanced.

162,"Tart and complex, very refreshing. Nice balance of fruit and vegetal flavors, hint of mortality and good acidity."

187,"Beautifully light yet crisp with tangerines and peach on the nose. Apple, pear and gooseberries enlighten the palate."
188,"3.5 stars An acid explosion with a cream finish. The only Gruner Veltliner that my wine store offers (and my first). I would like to explore others, but this was a decent introduction. I won't say that it'll replace my chardonnay or my viognier. Something about the shape of the bottle is oddly alluring, though. I found the same to be with my Alexander Valley Sangiovese Rose."
189,"3.7 Hallo from Austria with this appetizer. Peach, pear, apple, quince, white currant, grapefruit all in fine minerality. A slightly tart finish, otherwise all rest is ok."

328,"Great crisp and mineral Veltiner. So true to the varietal fruity on the nose, crisp and clean easy drinker."
329,"Well made and indicative for Gruner. Somewhat like a Riesling, though less powerfully aromatic and also has a really nice sweet sage aroma. Otherwise dominated by malic green fruit, apple, pear, lemon, wet slate."
330,"3.4 Middle powerful aroma of green apple and pear, dusty ample lemon and lime, blossoming pale yellow and white flowers. Dry, high acidity, medium body, small concentrated bubbles, taste is straight and fresh, harshy a bit from the first perception, than salty bitterness arrives with some minerals, not long finish."
331,Lunch Quaffer at Whitegrass (Chef Takuya Yamashita). Easy going GV with lively acidity. Rock minerality. Grass. White peach. Celery. Paired well with the executive lunch menu with mix of seafood and poultry dishes.

335,"Light golden yellow colour with green and silver reflexes. Juicy pears, ripe yellow apples, some melons and nice minerality, fresh acidity and medium long finish."
336,"More body than your typical gr√ºner, but still has the typical honey, apple and honey notes. Maybe slightly more mineral-y than i'm used to, but still yum."
337,Pale yellow with slightly green reflexes. Discret flavors of white peach and apricot a bit of almond slightly mineral. Medium body juicy acidity and medium long finish.
338,Probably the best veltliner I have ever had .... it was green grapes apples and light minerals but all with a velvet wrap of smooth fruit that holds a tad of sugar
339,"Score: 3.8 Acidity: high Sweet: dry Asparagus flavor, like Sauvignon Blanc. Because high acidity and low sweetness, the taste is very thin and not balanced well."
340,"Fresh Gr√ºner Veltliner from Wachau. Grey pears, blossoms, pepper, lime, citrus and minerals. Dry with fresh taste of citrus with a peppery, salty finish"
341,"Citrus and lime, pineapple, touch of oak, Flint on the nose. Pretty good body and structure with very little RS. Palate shows hints of green. Enjoyable wine."
342,"Quite simple, with green apple and hints of white pepper. Palate dry, bit of texture or creaminess. Finish medium. Would be quite nice on a hot summer day"
343,"Golden yellow, crisp and fresh, with medium body. A hint of citrus and green apple, flinty finish. Nice gruner, but I prefer a more fruity or floral palate."
344,You can't go wrong with this Gr√ºVe
345,"Nice, clean, refreshing wine. Surprisingly slightly tart, where I expected sweet. My first Austrian wine, I believe. I'm impressed and will definitely buy again."
346,"Crisp, delicate Gr√ºner as it should be. Green apple, pineapple, pear to the palate and forest flower aromas. Austrian Gr√ºner from Wachau never disappoints !"
347,"Dry, fruity and full of acidity, a good Austrian wine"
348,"Mild lemon-lime base with a pronounced minerality throughout. Honey, cantaloupe flavors on a finish that I would say is relatively heavy for a Gruner."
349,"Pale straw yellow colour. On the nose peaches, passion fruit, hire floral notes and minerals. On the palate medium bodied with high acidity and a long citrus finish."
350,"Light with high acidity and a pleasant soft bitterness. Green apple and citrus on the nose. Dry, crisp and steely on the palate with flavour of green apple."
351,Amazing. Tastes like it could be a cousin of a good Muscadet echoing good minerality and zingy acidity with deep citrus and some faint tropical flavours. Big winner.
352,"Gosh I loved this gruner, with plentiful acid to make it super crisp and refreshing to drink. Aromas of white flowers, melon and pear. Yum."
353,Bill says 3.5 and I say 3. The unique flavor means it isn‚Äôt great alone but it vastly improved and was enjoyed with chicken and boc choy spicy stir fry.
354,"It's good without being particularly exciting. Crisp, slightly floral and aromatic, with a nice acidity. Great accompaniment to spicy foods, but probably wouldn't look for it to sip on its own"
355,"Crisp green apple on the nose is about all I get, but it's about all I need. Stone and apple peel on the palate. What I wouldn't give for some cheese fondue and strudel!"
356,"Very crisp, refreshing, high acid. Good summer wine, or pairing with seafood. I ate it with a Shackburger from Shake Shack because I like to live on the edge like that. That worked too."
357,"Tangerine and white flowers. Nectarine and white peach with beautiful jalape√±o spice. Very solid entry level Gruner. Acidity medium, alcohol medium - (12.5%), medium body. Nice!"
358,"Wonderful, bracing acidity and slightly funky!"
359,"Medium+ acidity, medium alcohol, medium body, medium+ length with flavours of green apple, white flowers, melon and wet stone. Very tasty and just in to the mid price point at $21. Very good wine!"
360,Always miss this wine blind. Much more of a fruit forward style of gr√ºner. Some spice elements but not overly white pepper or radish like you would see in a more classic example.
361,Well in fact this is not a wine but a brandy with a taste more like a rakya. Deep amber colour. Mild fruity taste. 40% of alcohol but so smooth you can not find it. Noble finish.
362,"Very nice Gruner, just short of being excellent. Nice bright fruit, well rounded juicy acidity and good mineral finish. All things you are looking for in this varietal at a good price point. 89Pts"
363,"Good quality per price. 100% Gruner Veltliner from Wachau, Austria üá¶üáπ. Typical notes of apple, citrus, peach, pear, grass, pineapple and white pepper. Medium body, high acidity, high minerality"

366,"Dry, rich and fresh. Crispy hint of citrus. A taste of summer!"
367,"aroma of green apple, tones of grapefruit and pears"
368,Nice champagne-like colour with a grey tint. Nose not intense with some white fruit notes. Off-dry with peach on the tongue with a little flinty dyness. A touch of creamy mouth feel.
369,"Decent, consistent GV. Lovely nose of pear, grapefruit, hint of pepper. Palate explodes with apricot, lemon, lime, capsicum and white pepper in the finish. Typical mouth watering acidity."
370,"Light straw colour, green fruits aromas, Citrus, herberous, short finish."
371,"Nose is of stone, minerals and green apple or pear, with high acidity that lingers as is usual for Gr√ºner Veltliners. Not usually my preferred style of white wine but not bad. 3.3"
372,"Nice basic Gr√ºner Veltliner from Wachau. Refreshing, easy-to-drink wine after a long day. Citrus, green apple for the open. Nice acidity, medium body. Maracuja, pear - maybe - on the palate."
373,Cheers! Served on our ship and enjoyed the fruit and dry!
374,"Nice and dry, albeit lacking much distinctiveness. Paired nicely with a variety of small plates at Superba Snack Bar. It fill the bill perfectly."
375,"pale lemon, medium minus intensity, simple, bananas, pineapple, lychee, mango, peach lemon lime. Youthful dry high acid medium body"
376,Good Gruner falling just short of a score of 4/5. Clean and crisp colour with a nose of apples. Good minerality and delicate fruits on the palate.
377,"Light, Med+ acidity, low tannins and dry. Pear, green apple, pineapple juice, minerals, spice and light Chardonnay butteriness. Good value."
378,"Vienna 2018: Starting dinner with a typical Gr√ºner Veltliner. Young, fresh and a slightly typical black pepper touch. Cheers - Salud - Prost"

380,"N: pear, banana, citron P: light bodied, dry, medium acidity, medium- minerality T: follows nose less sweet F: short, consistent"
381,"Not bad for a hot summer day, but I felt alcohol is too much in your face and overall nothing particularly interesting. Green apple, melon."
382,Nice QPR. Apricot and white peach with some citrus and a lemon zest on the finish. A very light funk that adds to the character.
383,"Very well balanced Veltliner with a soft and tender acidity. Not one of the harsh and pepper tasting Veltliner, but easy to drink. 12,0 vol%"
384,"Light, mineral and fruity Gruner Vetliner. Easy to drink. Pale yellow colour. High acidity. Green apple in taste. A bit blandness finish."
385,"Distinctive. Yellow apple, citrus, white pepper. High acidity. Pairs beautifully with Wiener schnitzel and Austrian potato and cucumber salads"
386,"sharp and high on acidity. lime, pepper, citrus fruits, floral aromas. medium, acidic finish. refreshing GV but I prefere others."
387,Nice entry level with decent green and citrus fruit and high refreshing acidity. Not a stunner but a solid introduction to the proper stuff.
388,Very light nose hinted at wet grass. Continues with a light body and flavors of pear and lemon peel. Flat finish and not quite worth a second look.
389,"Creamy,yummy,served cold,melon,apricot,toast,light vanilla,drank whilst watching UK vs Iceland,amazing and happy,great drop,enjoyüåü"
390,"Pear and grapefruit on the nose. Beautiful notes of honey, apple and citrus on the palate. Nice acidity, helps cut through rich grilled fish!"

393,"Light straw color. In the aroma of peaches, pineapple, caramel shades, green grass, then spicy development. The taste is very light, elegant, citrus."
394,"Solid white that comes across similar to a Trimbach Gewurztraminer... higher sugar than a Pinot Gris but also a more solid, lengthy body... a beast to have on a sunny afternoon's day."
395,"Crispy taste, with enough flavor and frutiness. Hints of green apple, citrus, good value for the price."
396,"Pale yellow in color. Pear, green apple, lime, honey, dust, floral, marjoram, grass, and faint white pepper on the nose. Green apple, lemon, and a green vegetable note on the palate. Dry with a crisp acidity and medium body. Tart lime finish that lingers done the middle of the tongue."
397,"üëÅ Clear, medium gold. üëÉüèª Lemon, green apple, pear, pineapple, with vegetal notes of straw, salt and savoury white pepper. Slight cheese note. üëÖ Mostly dry, medium body and acid.

Neutral, stainless steel aged clean and crisp. Heavy stone fruit body. Bright vibrant acidity. Finishes tart and sour."
400,"Finally bagged the big fish! ...In this case, the most expensive GV that we sell at my store and the only one I had left to try. Fruity aromas of golden delicious apple, ginger, lime juice, passion fruit, and rambutan with hints of radish and quince. Savory lime and white pepper on the palate. Medium body with bright acidity. Perfect accompaniment to many foods or on its own!"
401,"Crisp Gruner from Austria. This wine was light in color with green flecks - no visible sediment, and medium minus viscosity. The nose showed lemon, grapefruit, and plenty of herbs and spices (white pepper). The palate is lively and fresh with acid. No disappointments on this bottle. Cheers!"
402,"3.6 - Federspiel is derived from falconry which was a leisure activity of nobilty in medieval times. 12.5% abv with only 1.4g of RS. As you‚Äôd expect with a low sugar content this is a dry style of the GV expression. Golden & slightly green colour to the naked eye. Not a very aromatic wine but what there is on the nose I sense green apple, white pepper & pear. On the palette a crisp medium body with medium acidity with juicy green apple & white pepper following through. A good length to finish."
403,"It is quite possible that I have given the kids my wine, while I drink their apple juiceüò≥ Slight plastic notes on the nose, but otherwise just full of crisp green apple. Palate is, for a change, apple with some oily characteristics"
404,"Tonight was cook at home night with steamed coral trout, ginger and black bean sauce inspired by this bottle of Gruner. Worked wonderfully! It's flinty like a Chablis just more oily like a Viognier and uniquely spicy like a Gruner. lots of unique spice aromas: ginger, pepper, basil. Med body, med alcohol, med-long length."
405,"Excellent Veltliner- dry with crisp citrus and thyme notes, some nutty hints and a marvelous velvet finish, despite the distang hint of a bubble. Lovely stuff; a tad weighty at 13pct but not enough to mark it down more than a half-star."
406,"Have always loved this variety. Golden is the glass with pronounced notes of lemon, lemon pith and spice. The citrus continues onto the palate with more defined lemon juice rather than pith with yellow grapefruit coming through also. Hints of honeysuckle and chamomile dance around the citrus with a soft spice known in Gruner Veltliner. It is medium bodied with balanced acidity that delivers a beautiful freshness and mouthfeel. A great accompaniment to light thai curries or a white flesh dish with substance."
407,An interesting spice to it
408,"Nice minerality, peach, nectarine and really nice and ripe on the nose. Light citrus on the palate, crisp acidity and more of that ripeness and a very slight honeyed quality, possibly slightly late harvest in parts? Nice refresher of a wine"
409,"A medium bodied austrian delight! Gr√ºner is a perfect drink for the Australian summer! Crisp and dry with aromas of green apples, lychee and honeysuckle. The finish was clean with a touch of white pepper spiciness!"
410,Nice light white wine
411,"It took me a bout a million swirls and snuffs to appreciate the nuance between this varietal and Riesling, but I think I've finally had a breakthrough. White pepper, lime, grassy notes and zesty acidity really make this wine something special."
412,Clear Pale Yellow green Medium-aroma Citrus Lemon Lime Floral Youthful Dry Medium - alcohol Light body No tannin Medium + acid Lemon Lime Celery Mineral Pepper hint This is a good wine Drink now Suitable for aging
413,"Little sweeter than our preferred Gruner, but delicious nonetheless, love the Wachau!"
414,"Aromas of tart apples and lime blossom. Med plus acidity, medium body. Lingering citrus finish. Versatile, good value wine for $15!"
415,"Happy White Wine Wednesday! Pale yellow color with silver watery rim. Aromas of wet rock and citrus zest on the nose. Lots of mineral notes upfront with green fruits. Flint and saline with watered down lime juice, green honeydew melon, underripe starfruit. Dry with a slight effervescent tingle and medium acidity. Very light and refreshing! A Good Gruner!!üëçüèªü•Ç"
416,Simple white with medium body and medium plus acid. Pears on the palate and nose. Minerals and finishes with nice medium plus acid. This wine had a bit of fizz early that dissipated with time. Good with sushi
417,"Cut grass, melon and tart nose. Quite acidic, lengthy due to acidity, but pleasant. Apple and pear and almond. Interesting varietal. Would drink again. Not heavily chilled, but cool enough to tame the acidity."
418,"Servus √ñsterreich! What a refreshing change of scenery in the white wine cupboard. So glad we get the opportunity to taste these Austrians in Australia. Peach and spice (vanilla) embedded in some minerality, everything in beautiful harmony and well balanced. The best $23 spent on a white wine in a long time."
419,"2017 vintage tasted April 2018. Grapefruit-lemon flavours, slightly tart, and chalk/mineral characteristics. It was a bit too restrained when first opened and better after a day in the fridge - so worth letting it breathe and could be a candidate to cellar for a while. I had it by itself and think it'd be well-served with chicken or cheese. 3.4 stars: v.good."
420,"Light yellow Apple notes with the spicy, white paper finish you'd expect from a high quality Gruner. I love the citrus notes along with the earthiness that encompasses the pepper notes with the acidity that I look for to denote a high quality wine. Buy. Drink. Repeat."
421,"Lovely savoury citrus nose, lemon sorbet accent The pallet is a very refreshing lime, lemon, dried citrus savoury, smooth & almost creamy.. Peach apricot back end into the tail, mid length Totally enjoyable!"
422,"3,4‚≠êÔ∏è Bright green-yellow In the nose light aromas of pear, citrus and green herbs. On the palate fresh and dry, lime, lemon and grapefruit biting, radish and white pebber in the finish. Medium body, high acidity and medium alcohol. Had it for Danish ‚Äútarteletter‚Äù.. - went well!"
423,"Dom√§ne Wachau is perhaps the most revered winery in Austria and this Gr√ºner is a good example of why. Lots of complexity on the layers of crisp flavours - tart lime zest leading to fresh melon, underripe stone fruit, a hint of spice and a lingering minerality on the finish."
424,"3,7 Greenish color, green apple, pepper and citruses in a bright aroma. Cherry-plum and citruses in the taste, pepper is clearly appeared in the aftertaste. Acidity is above average, noticeable bitterness. Feels tannin a little bit."
425,"Nose: yellow apple, citrus, lime zest, green pear, & minerals. Palate: grippy acidity & full body. Green apple warhead, grapefruit, honeydew, & herbaceous. Opinion: best value you‚Äôll get for a Gr√ºner Veltliner. $12 bottle from Bottle Barn. Wachau is in lower Austria and is one of the most premier grape growing regions. Delicious wine!"
426,"New vintage tasted. Yellow apples, lime, pear, tutti frutti, grapefruit, hay and minerality. Dry, med bodied, med+ acidity. Taste follows the nose citrus fruits and pear pronounced. Medium zesty finish. Good quality and great QPR!"
427,"In the glass a golden yellow color with greenish hue. On the nose flavors of nuts, lemon, green apple, light pepper and fine herbs. Nicely balanced and juicy, ripe fruit in the mouth, with a nice long finish."
428,"This wonderfully dry Austrian cleanses the palate nicely. I paired it with shrimp saut√©ed in garlic and thick cut Taiwanese noodles providing an astounding contrast of spicy Asian cuisine and the acidic grapefruit and spicy green apple. Easy to imagine this as a perfect pairing with raw oysters, crab and mussels:"
429,Great summer wine. Dry and citrusy. Great minerality.
430,"Dry and crisp, full on citrus on the nose, grapefruit, and lemon with just the slightest hints of firm apricot, lovely palate, sharp defined citrus, the tangy side of yellow stone fruit keeping the acidity pleasant, finishes off with just a bit of bitter grapefruit pith finding it's way through, crisp throughout and finishes a bit too quickly but very clean, will be keeping my eye out for more GV."
431,"I don't drink a lot of GruVees, so lack basis for comparison, but here's what I can say about it: Mineral nose, very clean. Palate is also very clean, with mineral, a spicy element, and lemons, the latter emerging more with time. Great wine for simply grilled fish or oysters. Great bang for the buck at under $15."
432,Apples and good acid balance. Had with Indian food and it was a good value wine and food friendly option. Would buy again. Even the people that say ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt like‚Äù these types of wines enjoyed it
433,"Medium nose of apple, lemon, tropical fruit, almonds and grass. Light body with notes of smoke, mint candy, pear and stone. Would be nice with white fish, seafood, cheeses, cabbage and wienerschnitzel."
434,"Start of the weekend with this Gr√ºner Veltliner from Dom√§ne Wachau - Federspiel Liebenberg 2015 (3.7). Full citrus hints, pear and fresh mowed grass. Nice in minerals, slight hints of flint. Fresh and clear wine, very nice!"
435,"So Thursday brings on a soft curve upwards with a nice Austrian white. It's crisp crystal clear mineral white with slight emerald straw shine. A strange nose of fresh pear, faint madras curry, a little gunpowder and chicken stock. On the tongue it's soft acidity with a tender prickle, slight mineral taste notes combined with pomelo/citrus fruits and a faint oaky/smoked aftertaste. The texture is a little watery and the finale is short to medium with a lingering acidity and faint white bread impressions."
436,"Plums, sour apples, leather"
437,"Rocket, white pepper and green apple on the nose, Nice bit of funk on the palate, supple weight, soft phenolic finish with good length."
438,"Tried in May 2016. Nose : clean, med intensity of fresh green apple, chalky mineral notes and hint of cut grass. Palate : Dry, med acidity, med alcohol, med- body med intensity of green vegetable and lot of minerality."
439,"Just laying on a beach on tropical island in Thailand and decided to catch up on some TNs from my recent trip to Australia. This GV was your classic flavors. Stone fruit, green apples and a hint of grapefruit with a dry finish. Medium body and pleasant throughout. 3.6üåü"
440,"In the glass, crystal clear, no legs, pale yellow. On the nose: golden delicious apple, pear, wet stone. On the palate: dry; I love the acidity; well balanced, smooth, even, fruity. Nice finish. Well made. 88 points. Drink now."
441,"Moderate intensity of tart green apple, lemon, faint cream, lees, and an undercurrent of vegetal notes‚Äîwatercress/root vegetables. High zippy acid drive the citrus/spice laden palate that has just enough weight/texture to finish in a balanced fashion."
442,"A beautiful GV from famed Austrian producer. One of the better GV's out there, I think. My Hungarian friend Szabolcs B√∂r√∂czky summed it up best. ""Starting with minerality, grapefruit, apple,green ball pepper & opening up into honey, white flesh peach, white flowers & white pepper in the nose, medium plus body, medium plus acidity, minerality, citrus, apple & pear on the palate, medium plus finish. Balanced with nice minerality & decent ageing potential - also good value for money."" Try it!"
443,"This GV from Wachau (Austria), while more reserved than I hoped (on nose & palate) is still delicious as a midrange Federspiel. Nose subtly hints at tropical fruit, flowers & passion fruit with spice notes. Dry, crisp palate with nicely balanced acidity. Subtle tastes of juicy tropical fruit--mango, lychee & lemongrass--with white pepper notes & a mineral finish. WE: 91. Tasty, but I'd hoped for more from assertiveness from grapes grown on this steep, terraced vineyard."
444,"Nice Austrian Gruner Veltliener. Pale yellow greenish color with good viscosity. Fine nose with apples, white pepper and herbs. In the mouth it is medium body, bone dry, delicate, fresh, balanced and pretty drinkable with gentle fruitiness, spicy and mild bitterness in medium long mineral finish. Residual Sugar: 1g/l Acidity: 5,9g/l Alcohol: 12,5%"
445,"Fruits (pear, peach, apple, citrus and some tropical ones) rounded with honey on the nose. Minerals and salt with balanced acidity, plus already mentioned fruit cocktail on the palate. Short and mineral finish. Nice and moderately acidic medium body GV."
446,"3,7/5 Earthy and herbal Gr√ºner Veltliner Med lemon color Med+ nose, developing, citrus, grapefruit, green apple, pear, white peach, dried herbs, thyme, sage, savory, mint, arugula, white pepper, minerals, crushed gravel, saline, beeswax and honey Palate dry with some residuals, med body, high acid, med alcohol, steely texture, med+ flavors intensity and med+ herbal finish Nice wine, balanced, focused, refreshing and delicious."
447,"Drank this one last year as well and really liked it. Still lovely, but this vintage is a bit flatter than the 2013. Lovely nose, still that nice balance between honey and acid notes, but the body is missing something."
448,"My first wine from Wachau ever! Now I‚Äôm beginning to understand what people mean when they describe Austrian whites as ‚Äúlean.‚Äù Not overly aromatic. Smells like golden apple and pear, with a bit of lemon and crushed gravel. It has awesome mouthwatering acidity, and no sweetness (trocken!), with a pretty long finish but it is super duper clean and relatively light (even though it‚Äôs federspiel-‚Äúmid-weight‚Äù by Wachau standards). Tastes like it smells with a bitter, almost umami flavor like grilled asparagus üòã"
449,"Weekend for new wine styles! First time drinking an Austrian Gruner Veltlinger. Dry, crisp and refreshing with citrus and grapefruit, but quite more subtle than many similar style wines, such as the comparable Sauvignon Blanc."
450,"Haha... bought in the supermarket here in Austria. Together with a Smaragd from the same winery, to taste the difference. It seems I‚Äôve already had this Federspiel. Same opinion as before. Not too complex, but exceptionally nice. The Smaragd shows a bit more length and complexity though. 12% - ‚Ç¨8 @ Spar, Mayrhofen (A)"
451,"Probably a 3 star wine, half star more for the drinkability and the complexity of the nose. Lime, green pear, tropical fruits, white pepper and flinty notes. Medium body and acidity at the palate, oily and mineral with lemony flavours."
452,"3.7* Nose mineral with lemon grass, stones, freshness of breeze, minerals, steel and jasmine. In mouth still mineral but mixed with mint and lemon apple riched of herbs and bitter and something like a clove ... interesting one"
453,"Nose of yellow apples, white flowers, toast, and beeswax. Effervescent with flavours of pears, passionfruit, dried limes, almonds, beeswax, tarragon, medium acidity, and a lees-y viscosity. Blind, I would placed this in the Loire as a Sauvignon Blanc,... but what do I know."
454,Very nice GV - did a little blind tasting with a NZ Sauv Blanc - which my friends love and they loved this one better and even thought it is the Sauvignon Blanc Tells me - good minerality acidic and Papple (half peach half Apple) but more the strong aggressive green apples
455,A refreshing and typical GV with pear notes and great acidity that brings a palate of citrus (particularly lime) and spice. Thoroughly enjoyable for the price.
456,Spiced pear and fruity on the nose. Quick finish with some spritz. I get flavors of lemon zest and pear with some minerality. Quite lovely on its own!
457,Tasting dinner at D√©fi in Syracuse. If you find yourself in Syracuse go here and let chefs Cody and Nick serve you whatever they suggest. A simple fresh Gruner.
458,"An easy drink my Gruner. Very light colour, nose of peach and grapefruit. Very mineral on the palette with lemon, wet gravel, and more citrus flavour."
459,I must be missing something here. It's not as complex a Gr√ºner as I might have hoped. Lemon zest and bitter lime on the nose. Green apple and radish on the palate.
460,"Crisp, citrus, great acid, perfect fruit, not sweet but fruit is noticeable, perfect summer dry white wine. My favorite Gr√ºner so far. Bought at Bev Mo in Carlsbad, CA for $16."
461,"Solid Gruner that is crisp, but a bit flabby unless served quite cold. Still, a very drinkable wine at an affordable price."
462,Very much grass. A bit oily. Citrus. Fresh and full of minerals. It worked very well with saffron fish stew.
463,"Solera tasting Fruity style Gr√ºner Veltliner, hand picked grapes from steep terraces of Federspiel."
464,Fragrance of green apple. Dry and mineral taste.
465,Something new for me. Riesling citrus flavours with an almost Viognier mineral mouth feel. Very enjoyable.
466,Like it would buy again
467,Light and easy to drink. Low acidity. Perfect for a lush summer evening outside.
468,Love this mineraly crisp clean delicious wine. Great spring into summer wine.
469,This is light on preservatives for those who react to sulphites. A lovely fruity and slightly spicy flavour for something a bit different.
470,"My first Gruner... And I love it. Crisp, pleasantly tart, and a hint of spritz on the tongue. Green apple, lemon peel and white pepper. Delightful."
471,"I love this wine. Great acidity, minerality, and white pepper I love from a Gruner. I wish I could find it more often."
472,"Golden delicious apple, Meyer lemon, a honeyed quality on the nose with tart lime zest and herbs in the palate"
473,"Lemongrass tea like minerality. Green apple, white pepper then a lingering soft mildly sweet finish. Can't wait to pair with food!"
474,"Nose of peach, white blossom and almond. Palate of minerals, anise and fennel. Rather light wine, very refreshing."
475,Good value. Nice summer wine. Drank in Dominica courtesy of Max
476,"Backlog. Yellow Apple, pear. Fruit forward & refreshing. Served too warm - so didn‚Äôt get the right impression though."
477,"Right to the point gruner...nice to find this trap again. Great value, nice minerality, with a nice dry acidity!"
478,Perfect every day summer gr√ºner. Light citrus and green apple and melon. Medium acid. Chilled nicely for hot summer days.
479,"Pale yellow wine with greenish reflections. Green apple, citrus Rather high acidity. Medium finish"
